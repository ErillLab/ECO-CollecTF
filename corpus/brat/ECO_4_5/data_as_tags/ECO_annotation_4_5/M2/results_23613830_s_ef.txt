Identification of spd-3 Transcripts

As an initial step to characterize the regulation of spd-3 expression, <term sem="ECO:0000106" id="T1" ECOConfidence="Medium" AssertionStrength="High" Category="BioProc" NextSentence="Yes" NegativeStatement="No">northern blotting</term id="T1"> was done using RNA isolated during the post-exponential phase of growth from both the wild-type S. pyogenes strain NZ131 and an rgg mutant.
Two distinct transcripts were detected and both were more abundant in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 1), which was consistent with our previous finding that Rgg represses spd-3 expression [17].
The more abundant transcript was approximately 925 bp in length and accounted for 65% of the transcript signal, as determined by densitometry.



Mapping the spd-3 Transcriptional Start Sites

Primer extension analysis was used to determine the 5' termini of the two transcripts.
Extension with primer spd3PEc_96 (Table 1) showed a transcript that originated 27 bp upstream of the predicted spd-3 open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 2).
This origin, coupled with a putative transcriptional terminator 91 bp downstream of the spd-3 ORF, predicted a 919 bp transcript, which corresponded to the more abundant approximately 925 bp transcript detected by northern blotting (Fig. 1).
A variety of primers were used in attempts to identify the start site of the longer transcript by using primer extension; however, we were unable to do so, possibly due to secondary structure formed within the large untranslated region.
As an alternative approach, <term sem="ECO:0001820" id="T2" ECOConfidence="High" AssertionStrength="High" Category="SeqFeat" NextSentence="No" NegativeStatement="No">5' RACE</term id="T2"> was used and the results showed that the 5' terminus was 594 bp upstream of the spd-3 start codon (Fig 3).
The results predicted a 1,487 bp transcript, which also correlated with the size of the larger transcript identified with northern blotting (Fig. 1).
In addition, the start of transcription coincided with the non-coding DNA region previously shown to be bound by Rgg in vivo during the exponential phase of growth [24].
Analyses of the DNA proximal to the transcriptional start sites revealed the presence of putative -10 and -35 RNA polymerase binding sites (Fig. 3).
The two transcriptional start sites were designated P1 and P2 (Fig. 3).



Rgg Binds Specifically to DNA Containing the P1 and P2 Promoters

ChIP coupled with DNA genechips (ChIP-chip) and <term sem="ECO:0000096" id="T5" ECOConfidence="High" AssertionStrength="High" Category="MolFn" NextSentence="No" NegativeStatement="No">gel-shift assays</term id="T5"> previously showed that Rgg binds to P1[25]; however, we did not previously detect binding to P2.
Therefore, we re-analyzed Rgg binding to both sites by using the more sensitive <term sem="ECO:0000228" id="T3" ECOConfidence="High" AssertionStrength="High" Category="BioProc" NextSentence="Yes" NegativeStatement="No">ChIP-qPCR</term id="T3"> procedure.
As expected, DNA containing P1 was enriched by approximately 9-fold in strain SA5, which encodes an Rgg-Myc fusion protein used to facilitate immunoprecipitation, compared to the control strain (Fig. 4).
In addition, the P2 region was enriched nearly 75-fold (Fig. 4).
The results show that Rgg binds to both the P1 and P2 DNA (Fig. 4).
Binding near P2 was further evaluated with gel-shift assays and the results confirmed that Rgg specifically binds to DNA containing P2 (Fig. 5).



Rgg Directly Regulates spd-3 Expression

To characterize the two spd-3 promoters further, prophage DNA regions bound by Rgg (P1 and P2) were cloned adjacent to a promoterless firefly luciferase (luc) gene present in the shuttle plasmid pKSM720 [26].
The recombinant plasmids were used to transform both the wild-type and the rgg mutant strains to determine if expression from P1 and P2 was regulated by Rgg.
The use of the <term sem="ECO:0000049" id="T4" ECOConfidence="High" AssertionStrength="High" Category="BioProc" NextSentence="Yes" NegativeStatement="No">plasmid based reporter system</term id="T4"> also allowed us to measure promoter activity apart from the prophage, thus avoiding confounding factors potentially associated with prophage induction, such as variation in gene copy number.
Promoter activity was detected with P2 DNA and the presence of Rgg in the wild-type strain decreased transcription, consistent with other data indicating that Rgg represses spd-3 transcription (Table 2).
Similarly, a fragment containing both spd-3 promoters (P1 and P2), showed significantly more activity compared to the fragment containing only P2 (Table 2).
Again, more promoter activity was detected in the rgg mutant strain, consistent with Rgg-dependent repression of spd-3 expression by direct binding to the promoter regions (Table 2).



Rgg Acts in cis to regulate spd-3 Promoters

Finally, we used the transcriptional reporter system and ChiP-qPCR to determine if Rgg bound in cis to regulate expression of the luc gene.
One PCR primer was specific to luc and a second was upstream of P1.
The results showed that Rgg bound directly to the plasmid DNA to repress expression of luc (Fig. 6).
