Weight matrix prediction of potential PhoB regulated genes

A weight matrix to identify potential PhoB binding sites was generated from five S.meliloti and ten E.coli PhoB box example sequences of 18 nt length (Table 1).
The nucleotide frequency matrix was used to calculate an information-based score for potential binding sites in a scan of the S.meliloti genome.
Putative PhoB binding sites were defined by a score of greater than 0.35 and a location between +100 and -500 nt of the translational start codon on the transcribed strand of an annotated gene (see Materials and Methods).
One hundred and three putative PhoB binding sites were found and are shown with their downstream annotated genes in Supplementary Table S1.
Seven of these promoter regions contained two putative PhoB boxes, so that 96 distinct genes were found.
Three out of four genes whose Pho boxes were used for matrix construction were also among those 96 genes.
No orthologue of orfA-pta-ackA from S.meliloti strain 104A14 was found in Rm1021 strain.

The threshold score (0.35) used to identify putative PhoB binding sites was derived from the lowest score (that of orfA-pit) among the example sequences.
With this threshold, 18 of the top 20 scores were upstream of genes found to be induced by phosphate starvation, in a PhoB-dependent manner, by gusA fusion analysis in S.meliloti (see next section).
However, most putative PhoB binding sites with scores above the cut-off level did not show phosphate-dependent regulation of transcription.
Possible explanations in addition to false positives are that the matrix method did not include other important features of a PhoB binding site, such as appropriately positioned -10 and -35 promoter elements.
It is also possible that some genes with PhoB binding sites require interaction with additional regulatory proteins before the gene can be regulated by phosphate limitation.

Blanco et al. (23) showed that the C-terminal domain of PhoB interacts with a 22 bp region of dsDNA that consists of two direct repeats of 11 bp.
Each 11 bp repeat has a conserved 7 bp region (consensus, CTGTCAT) followed by a less conserved 4 bp segment.
Our weight matrix is comprised of two conserved 7 bp repeats separated by a single, less conserved 4 bp spacer, and omits the terminal 4 bp segment.
However, this terminal segment is not well conserved (23) and will therefore contribute little to the weight matrix score.
Furthermore, our weight matrix will reliably identify overlapping PhoB sites provided that they are separated by 4 bp 'spacers' and individually have component scores greater than 0.35.



Experimental validation of the predicted Pho regulon members by analysis of transcriptional gene fusions

To directly examine whether the S.meliloti genes identified by the frequency matrix were subject to phosphate-dependent regulation, we generated transcriptional reporter gene fusions to seventy-two of these candidate genes and examined their expression in defined MOPS-buffered minimal medium during growth under Pi-excess (2 mM Pi) and Pi-starvation (no Pi added) conditions (see Materials and Methods).
Gene expression in a wild-type phoB+ background was compared with expression in an otherwise isogenic phoB- background (Table 2).
Eighteen of the 72 promoter gene fusions were induced upon Pi-starvation in a PhoB-dependent fashion (Table 2).
In addition, regardless of the media Pi concentration, gene fusions to smb20427 (putative amino acid ABC transport system), smc02886 and smc02675 (rrna) showed 3-, 2- and 10-fold more expression respectively in the wild-type background relative to the phoB- background.

Three reporter gene fusions were found to be repressed upon Pi-starvation in a PhoB-dependent manner.
These were smc00801 (transmembrane protein of unknown function), smc02601 (nadABC) and smc02862 (orfA-pit).
In the wild-type background these fusions were expressed at higher levels in media containing 2 mM Pi than in Pi-starved cells.
Also, in the phoB mutant background the expression level was elevated and did not alter with media Pi.
We have previously reported that expression of the low-affinity Pi-transport system encoded by the orfA-pit genes is repressed by PhoB (28).
The repression of smc02601- smc02602- smc02603 (nadABC) expression suggests that the observed down regulation of NAD+ synthesis in S.meliloti possibly corresponds to a slight down regulation of smc00161 expression that appears to occur upon Pi-limited growth (Table 2).
The smc00161 is annotated to encode an NH3-dependent NAD+ synthetase and the promoter region of this genes was predicted to carry a promoter Pho box (Supplementary Table S1).



Comparison of Pho box predictions with DNA microarray data

Employing DNA microarrays, Krol and Becker (31) identified 98 genes (some of which were in operons) that were more than 3-fold induced in a phoB-dependent manner upon Pi limitation.
An additional 50 genes showed a strong increase in expression under phosphate limitation in a partially phoB-dependent or phoB-independent manner.
Krol and Becker (31) also identified potential Pho-box sequences with LTEQ 2 mismatches from the Pho-box consensus sequence TG(A/T)CA (C/A)-NNNN-C(C/T)(G/T)TCA(C/T) defined by Summers et al. (16).
Of the 19 Pho-box promoters identified by Krol and Becker (31), 14 were also identified with our weight matrix (Table 3) and data from our gene fusion experiments (Table 2) revealed that 13 of these 14 genes were regulated by media Pi in a PhoB dependent manner (Table 2).
A reporter fusion to the remaining gene, sma0612 has yet to be examined.
Of the five Pho-boxes not identified by our weight matrix, four were unusual (sma1809, sma1822, smc00170 (sinR) and smc00429) as they contained 3 or 5 nt in the region flanked by the 7 nt direct repeats instead of the 4 (see Table 1).
The Pho-box upstream of the remaining gene, sma0045, lies on the opposite strand to sma0045 and thus would not be included in our predictions.
However reporter gene fusions to these genes should be analyzed as the microarray experiments suggested these genes were induced in a phoB-dependent manner (31).

In addition to the 13 Pho regulon members predicted both here and by Krol and Becker (31), both the weight matrix data and data from reporter fusion assays identified an additional 10 genes whose expression was PhoB-regulated in response to Pi limitation (Tables 2 and 3).
With the exceptions of smb20843 (algI), smc00618(ppk), smc02601(nadA) and smc00801(hypothetical, global homology), these genes also showed PhoB-dependent transcription in microarray studies.
The failure to detect repression of smc02601(nadA) and smc00801expression in microarray experiments is not surprising as the microarray experiments also failed to detect orfA-pit repression and this operon is known to be repressed by PhoB (25).
The failure to detect induction of smb20843 (algI), smc00618 (ppk), upon Pi-starvation is more surprising as these genes appear to be highly regulated in the gene fusion experiments.
Moreover expression of ppk is known to be Pi-starvation induced in many organisms.
The differences between the microarray and gene fusion data could result from several factors including differences in experimental growth conditions as in microarray experiments cells were grown in 100 microM Pi source as the Pi-limitation condition.
Alternatively, it is possible that the particular probes employed for ppk and smb20843 yielded low signals.
Through our weight matrix scan, Pho-box sequences were also found upstream of three more genes, sma2410 (rhbF), smc01296 (rpsN) and smc01820 (putative N-carbamyl-L-amino acid aminohydrolase) (Supplementary Table S1).
Promoter fusions to these three genes have not been tested yet.
These genes however are shown to be repressed in a PhoB-independent manner in microarray studies (31).
Further studies are required to analyze the regulation of these genes and the nature of their associated Pho-box sequences.

We note that in the case of orfA-pit, the Pho-box identified by Krol and Becker (31) lay on the opposite strand to the orfA-pit genes and is different from that identified by Bardin et al. (28).
Since orfA-pit expression is negatively regulated by PhoB, it is of interest to determine the actual PhoB binding site as little is known regarding how PhoB represses transcription.
In summary, of 96 genes with upstream Pho-boxes predicted by the frequency matrix genome analysis, 34 appear to be Pi and PhoB regulated as revealed from gene fusion and microarray analysis data (Table 3).



Analysis of predicted Pho regulon members across proteobacterial genomes

It is reasonable to assume that at least part of the physiological response to Pi-limitation will be conserved.
As the Pho-box sequence identified by the PhoB proteins of different organisms appears to be conserved (14,16,24,28,42 - 44), we used the Pho-box frequency matrix described above (Table 1) to search the genomes of twelve gram negative bacteria (Table 4) for PhoB-binding sites using the same criteria as employed for S.meliloti.
Genes that lay downstream of a predicted Pho-box with scores greater than 0.35 were further examined.
We identified genes, such as pstSCAB, phoA, ugpA, phn and ppk that are known to be associated with phosphate metabolism (Tables 5 - 7).
The pstS gene encodes the Pi-binding protein of the high affinity PstSCAB transport system (18,27) and expression of this system in E.coli, S.meliloti and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to be highly induced under Pi-limiting conditions and is PhoB dependent (27).
In a number of organisms, such as Caulobacter crescentus, the pstS gene transcript is separate from the pstCAB-phoUB transcript and in these cases predicted Pho-boxes are also located upstream of the pstC gene (see Table 5).

It was striking that multiple18 bp Pho-box sequences were predicted upstream of the pst genes in all of the genomes examined (Table 5).
Multiple Pho-boxes consisted of overlapping 7 bp direct repeats separated by 4 bp spacers.
The frequency matrix detected consecutive 18 bp elements and adding a terminal 4 bp spacer formed consecutive 22 bp PhoB binding sites as defined by Blanco et al. (23).
The two 11 bp direct repeat sequences bind the PhoB monomers head to tail (23).
The pstS promoters from E.coli K12 and O157:H7 are predicted to contain five and six of these 11 bp direct repeats, respectively.
The large number of Pho-boxes in all of the pstS promoter regions presumably reflects the importance of the PstSCAB high affinity transport system in the uptake of Pi under Pi-limiting conditions.
Other genes associated with phosphate metabolism for which multiple Pho-boxes sequences were detected included alkaline phosphatase-like proteins (phoA), genes involved in phosphonate uptake and metabolism (phn), in glycerol-3-phosphate uptake (ugp and glp), the regulatory genes phoB and phoR (Table 5) and genes encoding polyphosphate kinase (Table 6).

In addition to the previously reported Pho-box in the orfA-pit promoter region of S.meliloti, Pho-box sequences were also detected in the promoter region of the orfA-pit orthologues in the alpha-proteobacteria, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Mesorhizobium loti and the gamma-proteobacteria Pseudomonas putida and Acinetobacter sp (Table 5).
Bardin et al. (28) showed that the expression of orfA-pit in S.meliloti is repressed upon Pi-starvation, unlike in E.coli where the pit genes appear to be constitutively expressed (45) and for which no Pho-boxes were detected.
The identification of putative Pho-boxes upstream of the orfA-pit genes in other bacteria suggests that these may also be repressed by Pi-starvation and that such repression may be a widespread phenomenon.

A number of predicted Pho regulon members not normally associated with Pi metabolism were identified in several genomes (Table 7).
One of the genes in this category was katA encoding catalase and was recently shown to be PhoB dependent in S.meliloti and P.aeruginosa in Pi-starvation conditions (46).
The detection of Pho-box elements upstream of the katA genes of C.crescentus and P.putida suggests that katA expression in these organisms is also PhoB regulated.
Pho-boxes upstream of several S.meliloti ABC-class transport systems were also detected upstream of homologous clusters in other bacteria.
These were smc01605, smc04317 (afuA) and smc03124 (Table 7).
Both the afuABC and smc01605 gene clusters in S.meliloti are annotated as putatively involved in Fe+3 transport, however definitive evidence is lacking.
Choa et al., (47) did not find either of these ABC transport systems to be up-regulated in S.meliloti when grown in iron-limiting conditions.
Therefore, it appears unlikely that they are actually involved in iron transport.
A third ABC system in S.meliloti, smc03124, with conserved Pho-box sequences in other proteobacteria (Table 7), is annotated as a putative peptide binding protein.
The actual substrate(s) transported by this system is unknown.

We identified a putative Pho-box upstream of smc00772 (potH)- gene clusters well as orthologues in M.loti and Brucella suis (Table 7).
Although fusion data for smc00772 is unavailable, the potFGHI ABC-class, putative putrescine transporter cluster was identified as upregulated by Pi-limitation in the microarray analysis (31), although no Pho-box was identified by them.
The putative Pho-box upstream of smc00772 (potH) lies within the coding region of potG (smc00771), instead of upstream of the regulator (potF).
The fact that Pho-box-like sequences were identified upstream of genes similar to S.meliloti potH in M.loti and B.suis suggest that putrescine transport may be PhoB-regulated across a range of organisms and should be further investigated.

In response to Pi-starvation, S.meliloti replaces phospholipids with other non-Pi-containing lipids sulphoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (SL), ornithine-containing lipids (OL) and diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserines (DGTS) (48,49).
In Rhodobacter sphaeroides it was demonstrated that the smc01848 homolog btaA is directly involved in DGTS biosynthesis (50) and recently Lopez-Lara et al. (51) established that smc01848 and smc01849 (btaAB) are required for DGTS synthesis.
A Pho-box is predicted 64 nt from the smc01848 start codon and orthologs of smc01848 in M.loti (mlr1574) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (atu2119) also have predicted Pho boxes in the corresponding promoter regions (Table 5).
These data strongly suggest that DGTS synthesis induced upon Pi limitation is mediated directly via PhoR-PhoB system.



Pi starvation and polyphosphate metabolism

Inorganic polyphosphates (polyPi) are linear polymers of orthophosphate residues linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.
These polymers can vary in size from 3 to over 1000 phosphate residues.
PolyPi is ubiquitous and the enzyme primarily responsible for polyPi synthesis in E.coli is polyP kinase (PPK), which uses the gamma phosphate of ATP to make the polymer.
PolyPi can also be hydrolyzed to Pi either by exopolyhosphatases (PPX) or by endopolyphosphatases (PPN).
The identification and assignment of Pho-boxes was sometimes complicated by differences in genome annotation, as in the case of genes encoding polyphosphate kinase (ppk) (Table 6).
Here Pho boxes were predicted in the ppk promoter regions of 10 of the 12 genomes examined.
However, the predicted Pho-box from both M.loti (52) and C.crescentus (53) were located within the annotated gene coding regions.
Alignment of the Ppk amino acid sequence suggests that the actual start codons of the ppk genes in M.loti and C.crescentus are downstream of the annotated start codons (data not shown).
Our reporter gene fusion data showed that the S.meliloti ppk gene was strongly induced member of the Pho regulon.
However, most strikingly, the weight matrix did not detect a ppk Pho box either from the E.coli K12 genome or the E.coli O157 genome, even at very low cut-off (0.18).
In E.coli there is genetic evidence demonstrated that polyphosphates accumulate upon Pi starvation and depend on PhoB, although the E.coli ppk promoter has never been mapped.
Therefore, it is likely that E.coli PhoB regulates ppk indirectly as suggested elsewhere (54).

Identification and sequence analysis of the fhaB gene of B. holmesii

Based on short regions of highly conserved nucleotide sequences of the 5'- and 3'-ends of the fhaB genes of B. avium and B. pertussis oligonucleotide pairs Fha1F/Fha1R and Fha2F/Fha2R were designed and used for PCR amplification with chromosomal DNA of B. holmesii.
For both primer combinations PCR products could be amplified.
The sequence analysis of the amplified DNA fragments revealed significant similarity in particular in the deduced amino acid sequence to the respective fhaB sequences of the other Bordetellae.
By PCR amplification using the primer pair Fha1F/Fha1R, we found that all B. holmesii strains tested (B. holmesii G7702, B. holmesii G8341, B. holmesii ATCC51541 and B. holmesii No1) harbour orthologues of this fhaB gene (data not shown).
Using a genome walking strategy the DNA sequence of the fhaB gene of strain B. holmesii G7702 was completed.
The fhaB coding region of B. holmesii starts with a GTG codon and comprises 8,793 bp with a coding capacity for a 304 kDa protein, which is smaller than FHA of B. pertussis (367 kDa) but larger than the respective protein of B. avium (273 kDa).
The genome organisation of the fhaB locus of B. holmesii differs from that of the other Bordetella species.
In B. holmesii, upstream of the fhaB gene an open reading frame (orfMP) is located with significant similarity to a conserved integral membrane protein of B. bronchiseptica (BB3004) and B. parapertussis (BPP3041) which is transcribed divergently.
Directly downstream of the fhaB gene a copy of the insertion element IS1001 is located which is known to occur in B. holmesii and in B. parapertussis.
In contrast, in the species belonging to the B. bronchiseptica cluster the fhaB gene is arranged between the divergently transcribed bvgAS locus and the fimbrial operon fimABCD which precedes the fhaC gene whose gene product is involved in the export of FHA.
In B. avium an ORF encoding an ABC transporter is present upstream of fhaB, while the downstream gene organization is similar to the B. bronchiseptica cluster (Fig. 1) [3,17,18].

The overall similarity of the nucleotide sequence of the fhaB gene of B. holmesii with those of B. avium and B. pertussis is low (between 50% and 52%) explaining the failure of previous attempts to detect an fhaB orthologue in this species by Southern hybridization experiments (data not shown).
Even in those regions of the B. holmesii fhaB gene (e.g. within the first 600 bp) in which the predicted amino acid sequences of the FHA proteins are quite conserved (see below), the nucleotide sequence similarity is quite limited (59%).
On the level of the deduced amino acid sequences, the B. holmesii FHA protein shows an overall similarity of 55% to the FHA protein of B. avium (Fig. 1).
The similarity to the FHA, FhaL and FhaS proteins of the members of the B. bronchiseptica complex is less pronounced, e.g. 39.2% to FHA of B. pertussis as calculated using the EMBOSS pairwise alignment algorithms (Table 1).
With a sequence similarity of 37.3% the most similar protein outside of the genus Bordetella is an adhesin-like protein from Yersinia frederiksenii, an environmental bacterium that can also be associated with a wide variety of host organisms [28].
This analysis shows that FHA of B. holmesii is more similar to the B. avium protein than to the related factors of the mammalian pathogens, in line with previous observations that the BvgA, BvgS and RecA proteins of B. holmesii and B. avium are more closely related to each other than they are to those of the B. bronchiseptica complex [29,30].
This contrasts previous data obtained by comparison of the 16S rDNA sequences, which placed B. holmesii as a new species closer to B. pertussis than to B. avium.
On the other hand, recent evidence indicated that the gene encoding the 16S RNA of B. holmesii may have been acquired horizontally from B. pertussis [30].

For the Sec-dependent secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane, the B. holmesii FHA protein has an extended N-terminal signal sequence, which is very similar to that of the B. pertussis protein.
In B. pertussis, the signal sequence is cleaved at an alanine at sequence position 71 probably by the Lep signal peptidase [6].
The B. holmesii FHA protein has also an alanine residue at this position suggesting its processing at this site after transport through the cytoplasmic membrane.
In addition, the N-terminus of B. pertussis FHA harbours a domain about 250 amino acid residues in length which is essential for secretion through the outer membrane according to the two-partner secretion model, the so-called TPS domain [31].
The exact nature of the transport signal is not known so far, but two sequence motifs (NPNL and NPNGI) are well conserved among two-partner secreted proteins and at least the NPNL motif plays a role in the secretion of B. pertussis FHA [32].
Both sequence motifs are also present in the FHA protein of B. holmesii suggesting that it is also exported via a two-partner secretion mechanism.

Similarities of the B. holmesii protein with domains of the B. pertussis FHA protein possibly involved in adhesion including the heparin binding (aa 442 - 862) and carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) (aa 1141 - 1279) are very limited and the elucidation of relevant binding activities must await the biochemical characterization of the B. holmesii FHA protein.
An intriguing feature of the FHA protein of B. pertussis is the presence of an RGD motif (aa 1097 - 1099) enabling the protein to interact with integrin receptors [2].
The B. holmesii protein does not contain an RGD motif, instead at sequence position 742 - 744 it harbours a KGD motif (Fig. 2).
In some cases, KGD motifs may be involved in integrin binding [33,34], however, ascribing such a function to the KGD motif of the B. holmesii protein must await future experimental analysis.



Regulation of expression of the B. holmesii fhaB gene

Upstream of the fhaB gene a divergently transcribed gene is present suggesting that the fhaB gene has a promoter of its own.
To analyse the regulatory region of the fhaB gene (PfhaB) it was cloned upstream of a promoterless gfp gene in the broad host range vector pMMB208 and the resulting plasmid was introduced into B. holmesii.
By primer extension analysis with a gfp-specific primer three transcripts (P1 - P3) were identified initiating at sequence positions -58 (P1), -71 (P2) and -88 (P3) with respect to the translational start codon of the fhaB gene (Fig. 3).
No obvious -10 and -35 regions could be observed upstream of any of these putative transcriptional start sites.
To investigate whether, similar to the other Bordetellae, the BvgAS system is involved in the control of fhaB expression, primer extension analysis was performed on RNA extracted from a B. holmesii bvgAS mutant [27] harbouring the plasmid-borne PfhaB-gfp fusion.
Interestingly, the longest of the three transcripts (P3) was not detected in the bvgAS mutant indicating that the synthesis of this transcript is controlled by the BvgAS system, while the other transcripts are constitutively produced under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3).
Similarly, the fhaB gene of B. pertussis is controlled by a BvgAS regulated promoter, but some constitutive expression was noted [35].

Although the fhaB gene is transcribed in B. holmesii grown at standard culture conditions, various attempts to detect the B. holmesii FHA protein were not successful so far.
The B. holmesii strains used in this study grow very poorly in liquid culture reaching a maximal OD600 of about 0,5.
We were unable to detect a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to FHA in the culture supernatants neither by SDS PAGE nor by immune blotting using a polyclonal antiserum against the B. pertussis FHA protein.
Similarly, also in whole cell lysates of bacteria grown on BG agar plates no FHA protein could be detected (data not shown).
It is therefore possible, that the translation efficiency of the fhaB gene is low, which may be in line with the fact that the open reading frame starts with a GTG codon, or that the protein is processed to smaller fragments than the related proteins of the other Bordetellae.

To further investigate the transcriptional regulation of the fhaB gene by the BvgAS system we performed DNA binding experiments in vitro with purified recombinant BvgABH of B. holmesii [27].
In fact, in band shift experiments binding of the phosphorylated but not of the unphosphorylated BvgABH protein to the fhaB upstream region could be detected (Fig. 4).
Binding was specific since addition of unspecific competitor DNA did not interfere with binding of BvgABH-P even in the presence of a 1,000 fold excess of competitor DNA (data not shown).
To further characterize BvgA binding to the promoter region, DNase I footprint analysis with BvgABH of B. holmesii was performed.
Footprint experiments were carried out on a 312 bp DNA segment ranging from nucleotide position +29 to -283 as numbered with respect to the translational start site of the fhaB gene.
The addition of BvgABH-P to the reaction mixture resulted in a large region protected from DNase I digestion ranging from position -40 to -243 with respect to the start codon of fhaB.
Within the protected region the appearance of a regular pattern of hypersensitive sites every 10 to 11 nucleotides could be observed (Fig. 5), a phenomenon which was noted previously in the case of the promoter of the bvgAS operon of B. holmesii [27].
Surprisingly, the protected area covers all three transcriptional start sites mapped by primer extension analysis and, accordingly, includes the corresponding core promoter elements.
It is not clear whether this observation has in vivo relevance.

A search for putative BvgA binding sites within the fhaB promoter region revealed the presence of four sequence motifs termed BS1 to BS4, respectively, with similarities to the well defined BvgA binding sites in B. pertussis (Fig. 6) which are located within or close to the region protected by BvgABH-P in the footprint experiments.
BS2 and BS3 show high similarity to each other and consist of inverted repeat heptanucleotide sequences centered at position -117 and -65.5 relative to the start site of transcript P3.
The left and right half-site motifs of BS2 and BS3 match the consensus half-site motif for binding of B. pertussis BvgA (BvgABP) [15] in 4 and 5 (BS2) and 5 (BS3) out of seven positions.
BS1 is arranged as a direct heptanucleotide repeat whose half-sites match the consensus in 5 and 6 positions, respectively, and is centered at position -161.
BS4 which consists of an inverted repeat centered at position -47.5 shows the lowest similarity to the consensus heptanucleotide BvgABP binding motif (4 and 3 matches per half-site).
The fhaB promoter of B. pertussis comprises a heptanucleotide inverted repeat sequence with high affinity for BvgABP binding centered at position -88.5 relative to the transcriptional start, as well as two additional low affinity binding sites centered at position -67.5 and directly adjacent to the -35 region [14,15].
Cooperative binding of BvgABP to the secondary binding sites which show only limited similarity to the high-affinity inverted repeat motif is required for full transcriptional activation of the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis [15,35].
Remarkably, the positions of the low-affinity BvgABP binding sites in the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis and of BS3 and BS4 in the upstream region of fhaB from B. holmesii are almost identical.
However, while the high-affinity binding site in the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis is located immediately 5' adjacent to the low-affinity sites, the centers of the inverted repeat sequences BS2 and BS3 are located in a distance of 51 bp.
The most prominent sites showing hypersensitivity to DNase I cleavage in footprint experiments map to the region flanked by BS2 and BS3 (Fig. 5).

To investigate a functional role of these putative BvgA binding site(s) we performed a deletion analysis of the fhaB promoter region and carried out band shift assays with progressively 5'- truncated DNA fragments lacking BS1 to BS4.
As shown in Fig. 7, BvgABH-P bound equally well to DNA fragments comprising the four putative BvgA binding sites BS1 to BS4 and to a DNA fragment lacking BS1 suggesting a negligible role of BS1 for the activation of the BvgA-P dependent promoter of fhaB.
In agreement with this assumption, BS1 was only partially protected by BvgABH-P binding in DNase I footprint experiments (Fig. 6).
When BvgABH-P was incubated with a DNA fragment lacking both BS1 and BS2 still a distinct DNA-protein complex was formed, however, binding was significantly weaker since a much higher amount of BvgABH-P was required to achieve a band shift.
No significant binding of BvgABH-P was detectable to DNA fragments containing only BS4 or no BS box at all.
These data suggest a functional role of the highly similar BS2 and BS3 sites for binding of BvgABH-P to the fhaB upstream region.

To test whether these in vitro data have also relevance in vivo, DNA fragments containing various pieces of the fhaB upstream region were cloned in a promoterless gfp expression vector and transferred to the B. holmesii wild type and the bvgAS mutant strain.
GFP expression directed from the different constructs was used as a measure for promoter activity.
GFP expression was strong in the B. holmesii wild type strain harbouring construct pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0 containing the entire fhaB upstream region, while very low amounts of GFP were detected in the bvgAS mutant harbouring the same plasmid (Fig. 8, compare lanes 1 and 2).
These data confirm the BvgAS mediated regulation of fhaB expression which was already observed on the transcriptional level (Fig. 3).
Moreover, corroborating the in vitro data, GFP expression was virtually absent in strains B. holmesii G7702 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp4) and B. holmesii G7702 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp6) whose gfp expression plasmids contained only site BS4 or did not contain a BS site at all (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6).
In agreement with the results of the DNA binding experiments a dramatic increase in GFP expression could be noted when the fhaB upstream region in the gfp expression plasmids comprised BS3 or BS2 and BS3 in addition to BS4 (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 3).
The virtually identical GFP expression directed from the pMMB208-fhaP-gfp3 (containing BS3 and BS4) and pMMB208-fhaP-gfp2 (containing BS2 to BS4) plasmids was surprising since the EMSA studies reported above revealed a relatively weak binding of BvgABH-P to a promoter fragment containing BS3 and BS4, while binding to a fragment comprising BS2 to BS4 was very efficient suggesting a prominent role of BS2 for transcriptional activation.
Since BS3 is fairly similar to the consensus BvgABP binding motif and is located at the appropriate position to allow the interaction between BvgABH and the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, BvgABH binding to BS3 facilitated by DNA topology effects might be sufficient to fully activate the plasmid-borne fhaB promoter in pMMB208-fhaP-gfp3.
In the presence of the full length fhaB promoter cooperative protein interactions are likely be involved in the binding of BvgABH to the BS2/BS3 region.

To investigate whether the fhaB promoter of B. holmesii is also recognized by the BvgA protein of B. pertussis, the pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0 plasmid containing the entire promoter region of the B. holmesii fhaB gene fused to GFP was introduced into the B. pertussis strains Tohama I (TI) and BP359.
Strong GFP expression was observed by immunoblot analysis in the wildtype strain TI (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0), while expression of the reporter gene was hardly detectable in the bvgAS mutant BP359 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0) (data not shown).
Interestingly, primer extension analysis performed with RNA extracted from TI (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0) and BP359 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0) using a gfp-specific oligonucleotide demonstrated that in the wild type strain transcription of gfp starts at two sites, which, however, are identical to the start sites of transcripts P1 and P3 synthesized from constitutive (P1) and bvg-dependent (P3) dependent promoters in B. holmesii.
Moreover, as observed in B. holmesii, in B. pertussis the promoter directing the synthesis of transcript P3 is not transcribed anymore when the BvgAS system is inactivated (data not shown).
These data suggest that the activation mechanism of the fhaB promoter of B. holmesii by the BvgA proteins of B. holmesii and B. pertussis is remarkably similar.
This is surprising since it was recently shown that the BvgA protein of B. holmesii does not bind to and cannot activate the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis, although in particular in its C-terminal output domain it is highly related to the BvgA protein of B. pertussis [27,36].

The extended fructose-PTS gene cluster of C. glutamicum contains four transcriptional units

In the genome of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 [17], the locations of the five PTS genes ptsI, ptsH,ptsF, ptsG, and ptsS were identified.
On this account, the PTS genes can be grouped into the fructose-PTS gene cluster (ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH) and the distantly located glucose- and sucrose-PTS genes ptsG and ptsS, respectively, as well as the hitherto uncharacterized genes cg3365 and cg3366 (Table 1).
The genes ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH of the fructose-PTS cluster together with the region encoding sugR and cg2116 form the extended fructose-PTS gene cluster (Table 1).

In order to analyse the transcriptional organization of the extended fructose-PTS gene cluster, mRNA transcripts overlapping adjacent coding regions were investigated by real-time RT-PCR.
In these experiments, mRNAs spanning the intergenic regions between sugR and cg2116, cg2118 and fruK, fruK and ptsF, and between ptsF and ptsH, respectively, were detected in the C. glutamicum strain RES167 grown on glucose (data not shown).
However, a non-coding region of 188 bp between the coding regions of ptsF and ptsH was observed indicating a possible promoter upstream of ptsH.
Considering these observations and the localization of ptsI on the opposite strand, it is most likely, that the genes sugR-cg2116 and cg2118-fruK-ptsF form two operons, whereas ptsI is monocistronic.
Although a read-through transcription from ptsF to ptsH was detected, the ptsH gene is probably also transcribed monocistronically.
The operon predictions by the computer program VIMSS [25] and the predicted positions of transcriptional terminators 3' of cg2116, ptsI and ptsH determined by the computer program TransTerm [26], depicted as stem-loop structures in Fig. 1A, support this view.

Consistent with these interpretations, four transcriptional start sites were localized upstream from the genes sugR, ptsI, cg2118, and ptsH, using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (Fig. 1).
The deduced promoter sequences showed similarities to the sequences of the -10 (Tac/taaT) and -35 (TTTGCC/TTGGCA/TTGCCA) regions of the C. glutamicum consensus promoter [27].
The promoter of the cg2118-fruK-ptsF operon showed the highest similarity to the consensus promoter, whereas the promoters of sugR-cg2116, ptsI, and ptsH were less conserved, especially in the -35 region, (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, it was found that the divergent promoters PptsI and Pcg2118produce mRNAs overlapping by a complementary sequence of 14 nucleotides.



Transcription of the fructose-PTS gene cluster is enhanced in C. glutamicum cultures grown on glucose or fructose when compared to cultures grown on acetate

In order to investigate a carbon source-dependent expression of the genes belonging to the extended fructose-PTS gene cluster, the transcription levels were investigated by RT-PCR experiments.
For this purpose, total mRNA was isolated from C. glutamicum RES167, grown in minimal media containing acetate, glucose or fructose as a sole carbon source.
Glucose and fructose were employed as PTS sugars requiring the expression of the PTS gene cluster for their uptake, whereas acetate represents a non-PTS carbon source.
The relative mRNA amounts of the genes belonging to the extended fructose-PTS cluster (sugR to ptsH) were determined using real-time RT-PCR.
The values from the glucose- and fructose-grown cultures were compared to those obtained from cultures grown on acetate (Fig. 2).
The mRNA levels of sugR and cg2116 showed only minor changes during growth on glucose and fructose in comparison to acetate.
In contrast to this, all genes of the fructose-PTS gene cluster from cg2117 (ptsI) to cg2120 (ptsH) showed significantly higher mRNA levels during growth on glucose and fructose.
The levels of the genes ptsI and ptsH did not differ between cells grown on glucose and fructose.
This is in accordance with the need for expression in the presence of both sugars.
In contrast to this, mRNA isolated from fructose grown cultures showed significantly higher transcription of cg2118, fruK, and ptsF.
The different expression patterns of cg2118, fruK, and ptsF in cultures grown on glucose or fructose as sole carbon sources correlated with the requirement of the cell for a higher expression of the fructose-specific enzymeII (ptsF) and the 1-phosphofructokinase encoded by fruK with fructose as the sole carbon source.
These results are a clear indication for a carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation of the genes of the PTS cluster.



The sugR gene is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the fructose-PTS cluster containing ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH of C. glutamicum

Due to the classification of sugR and cg2118 as DeoR-type regulators, they are both interesting candidate genes for investigating their involvement in the carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation of the fructose-PTS cluster genes.
Single deletion mutants of sugR and cg2118 were constructed by gene replacement in C. glutamicum RES167 in order to elucidate the possible roles in this regulation (data not shown).
These deletions removed 242 of 780 nucleotides from the sugR coding region and 674 of 795 nucleotides from the cg2118 coding region, rendering the respective gene non-functional and resulting in strains LG01 (RES167 DeltasugR) and LG02 (RES167 Deltacg2118), respectively.

The possible involvement of sugR or cg2118 in transcriptional regulation of ptsI, the cg2118-fruK-ptsF operon, and ptsH was determined by real-time RT-PCR.
For these experiments, total mRNAs isolated from RES167 and the mutant strains LG01 and LG02 were used.
The cells were grown in shaking flasks in liquid minimal media with 2% acetate as sole carbon source.
Acetate as the sole carbon source was chosen, because an increased transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes could be observed when RES167 was grown on glucose and fructose instead on acetate.
Therefore, growth on acetate may cause the transcriptional repression of the fructose-PTS cluster genes.
To find out whether the sugR or the cg2118 gene product is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the fructose-PTS cluster genes, the expression in the two deletion mutants LG01 and LG02 was compared to the expression in the RES167 strain when all strains were grown on acetate.
The analysis revealed a strongly increased transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH in the sugR mutant LG01 (Fig. 3).
In contrast to this, the transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes in the cg2118 mutant LG02 was only weakly influenced.
It is therefore concluded, that the sugR gene product downregulates transcription of the fructose-PTS gene cluster during growth on acetate, whereas cg2118 and its gene product does not seem to be involved in the transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes under the applied experimental conditions.



The sugR gene of C. glutamicum is involved in the repression of PTS gene transcription

Comparative microarray hybridization experiments with total mRNA isolated from the cg2115 deletion mutant LG01 and the parental strain RES167 both grown on acetate were conducted in order to explore the complete SugR regulon.
In the microarray experiments using the C. glutamicum whole-genome DNA microarray described previously [28], two biological replicates were hybridized, simultaneously applying label-swapping.
The results of the microarray experiments comparing the sugR mutant and the RES167 strain revealed 23 genes with increased and five genes with decreased transcript levels in the sugR mutant.
All genes of the fructose-PTS gene cluster were found in the group of genes with induced transcript levels (Fig. 4 and Table 2).
Interestingly, the genes ptsG and ptsS, which encode the enzyme II proteins for the uptake of glucose and sucrose, respectively, were also found to have an elevated expression level.
To confirm the microarray results, subsequent real-time RT-PCR measurements were conducted, which validated the enhanced transcription of ptsG and ptsS in the sugR mutant with ratios of 16.8 and 101.8 compared to RES167, respectively.
Beside the PTS genes, the transcriptional levels of ldh and adhA encoding lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively, were found to be significantly increased.
Significant increases in transcript levels were also observed for cg2025 and cg2026, encoding hypothetical proteins.
Besides ldh and adhA, no further genes with known function in carbon metabolism were found to be significantly induced.

Since Engels and Wendisch [22] also compared global transcript levels by microarray hybridizations in a sugR mutant and its parent strain, the resulting stimulon can be compared to the one obtained in this work.
In the intersection of the genes showing elevated transcript levels in both experiments, only the PTS genes mentioned above are apparent.
The remaining genes corresponding to each stimulon are different between both studies and might be a result of the different growth conditions used (LB versus minimal media with acetate) or might be results of an indirect effect of the derepression of PTS gene transcription.



The SugR protein of C. glutamicum binds to sequences located upstream of the coding regions of ptsI, cg2118, ptsH, ptsG, and ptsS

To verify the direct involvement of the SugR protein in the regulation of the PTS gene cluster electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed.
For these experiments the SugR protein was purified after overexpression in E. coli as an N-terminal translational fusion with a self-cleavable intein tag using the pTYB1 vector [29].
The advantage of this system is that the native protein can be obtained without an additional attached tag sequence.
The quality of the purified protein was controlled by 1-dimensional SDS-PAGE and its size was estimated to be ~28 kDa.
This observation is in accordance with the annotation of the sugR coding region, which is predicted to encode a 27.6 kDa protein with an N-terminal DeoR-domain comprising a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif.
The identity of SugR was subsequently confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown).

As binding partners for SugR in the EMSA experiments, overlapping and fluorescently-labeled PCR fragments from the intergenic regions between ptsI and cg2118, as well as the regions upstream from the coding regions of sugR, ptsH, ptsG, ptsS, adhA, cg2025, and cg2026 were generated.
As negative controls, internal DNA fragments of the cg2118- and ptsH-coding region were also produced by PCR and incubated with the purified protein to test for non-specific binding of the protein (data not shown).

For the gel retardation experiments 15 pmol of the SugR protein and 0.05 pmol of the fluorescently-labeled PCR fragments were used.
It was shown that SugR caused band-shifts in experiments with DNA fragments I1, I2, and I4 located in the ptsI-cg2118 intergenic region (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, binding of the purified SugR protein was observed to the DNA fragment H1 which is located upstream of the ptsH coding region, to the fragments G1 and G2 located upstream of the ptsG coding region and to the fragments S1 to S3 derived upstream of the coding region of ptsS.

The promoter region of sugR was also tested for SugR binding, but no shifts of the labeled PCR fragments were detected (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, labeled PCR fragments upstream of the cg2025, cg2026, and adhA coding regions were tested in EMSA experiments, but no binding of SugR was observed (data not shown).



The C. glutamicum SugR repressor binds to two 21 bp DNA regions interfering with ptsI and cg2118-fruK-ptsF transcription

As described above, SugR binding was detected to the DNA fragments I2 and I4 located in the intergenic region between ptsI and cg2118.
In contrast, no binding to the DNA fragment I3 was observed.
These observations helped to identify two genetic regions A and B which are proposed to carry the specific binding sites for SugR (Fig. 6A).
Region A is a 59 bp long sub-region of the DNA fragment I2 and region B is a 87 bp long sub-region of I4.
DNA sequence comparison of regionA to regionB revealed highly similar sequences of 21 nucleotides in length.
To confirm these motifs as putative SugR binding sequences, double-stranded(ds)-oligonucleotides perfectly matching the 21 nucleotides with four flanking basepairs, representing the original genomic sequence on both sides, were used in competitive EMSA experiments and denoted as oligoA and oligoB, respectively (Fig. 6B).
Interestingly, both oligonucleotides were able to displace the labeled DNA fragment I2.
To further verify the binding sequence of SugR, ds-oligonucleotides with transversions of the four flanking basepairs of oligoA and oligoB, resulted in oligoAt and oligoBt, respectively, which were used in additional EMSA experiments (Fig. 6B).
OligoAt and oligoBt, however, showed no differences in the competitory EMSA experiments compared to oligoA and oligoB, defining both 21 bp long binding motifs as sufficient for SugR binding.
According to the localization of the two SugR binding motifs in regionA and regionB of the DNA fragments I2 and I4, respectively (Fig. 6A), these two motifs were named motifA and motifB.

Subsequently, the positions of the two 21 bp SugR binding sequences motifA and motifB were mapped in the intergenic region between the coding regions of ptsI and cg2118 (Fig. 7).
The two experimentally proven binding motifs in the intergenic region between ptsI and cg2118 are located within Pcg2118and downstream of PptsI (motifA), or downstream the Pcg2118(motifB), respectively.
Due to the divergent orientation of the coding regions ptsI and cg2118 and the overlapping transcripts from the promoters Pcg2118and PptsI, binding of SugR to motifA will interfere with transcription from both promoters, whereas the binding of SugR to motifB will only interfere with the transcription from Pcg2118.

To find additional binding sites of SugR, sequence alignments of motifA and motifB to the upstream coding regions of ptsH, ptsG and ptsS were conducted.
In these alignments, only DNA regions which showed a band-shift in the EMSA experiments were used.

By this, two putative binding motifs were found upstream of the coding regions of ptsH and ptsG and ptsS namely ptsH1, ptsH2 and ptsG1, ptsG2 and ptsS1, ptsS2 respectively (Fig. 8).
Concluding, these experiments led to the identification of eight binding motifs.
Two validated SugR binding sequences motifA and motifB located in the intergenic region of ptsI and cg2118, as well as six putative binding motifs located upstream of the coding regions of ptsH, ptsG, and ptsS.
Sequence alignments of all eight motifs revealed that the six nucleotides ACAAAC in the 5'- and the four nucleotides AACA in the 3'-region were well conserved (Fig. 8).
Additionally, a predominant occurence was observed for cytosine and adenine nucleotides at positions 9 to 17 of the consensus motif.
The characteristics of the putative consensus motif were determined as an A+C-rich and non-palindromic sequence (Fig. 8).



The effectors fructose-1-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate influence the binding activity of the SugR repressor

In order to determine the effector substances influencing the activity of SugR, additional EMSA experiments were carried out.
In these experiments, the SugR-I2 complex was incubated with fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P) which exclusively occurs when fructose is taken up by the fructose-specific PTS.
Additionally, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) occurring during the transport of glucose by the glucose-specific PTS component PtsG, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), originating from the consumption of different sugars, as intermediates of glycolysis were used.
Furthermore, the non-phosphorylated substrates of PtsF and PtsG, fructose and glucose, respectively, as well as acetate were used.

A loss of SugR binding to the DNA fragment I2 was observed to different extents using increasing concentrations of F-1-P, F-1,6-P, and G-6-P (Fig. 9).
Using F-1-P as effector substance a clear effect at concentrations equal to and exceeding 10 muM could be observed.
In the case of F-1,6-P, significantly higher concentrations of the effector substance ( GTEQ 5 mM) for resolving the SugR-I2 complex had to be applied.
Additionally, G-6-P showed significant influence on the SugR-I2 complex only at concentrations above 10 mM.
The binding of SugR to the DNA fragment I2 was not influenced by F-6-P concentrations up to 60 mM (Fig. 9).
Additionally, no influence was observed on SugR binding using the non-phosphorylated sugars glucose and fructose as well as acetate at concentrations up to 60 mM (data not shown).

Construction of a mce3R mutant in M. tuberculosis

As a first step to assess the mce3 operon expression in the absence of Mce3R, we obtained a knockout mutant strain of M. tuberculosis H37Rv by inserting a hygromycin cassette into the mce3R gene.
The site-directed mutant strain of M. tuberculosis was obtained by two-step mutagenesis strategy by using the p2NIL shuttle plasmid [21], which carries the lacZ gene and the counter selectable marker sacB.
Allelic exchange was confirmed in the selected clones (HyR, KmS, and SacR) by Southern blotting (Fig. 1A), since the mutant showed a hybridizing fragment of about 1.5 kb absent in the wild-type strain.
This polymorphism is due to the introduction of an extra EcoRI site present in the hygromycin cassette (Fig. 1B).
The mutant strain was designated Deltamce3R.
The mutation was complemented by transforming the plasmid pSummce3R into the mutant.



In vitro characterization of Deltamce3R

To determine whether mce3R disruption introduces alterations during in vitro growth, growth curves of the Deltamce3R mutant, complemented, and parental strains were compared under standard culture conditions.
All assayed strains showed similar doubling time and growth characteristics throughout the culture period (Fig. 2).
This result indicates that the mutation does not affect the in vitro growth of M. tuberculosis.



mce3 operon expression is repressed by Mce3R during in vitro culture and inside murine macrophages

We have previously demonstrated that the mce3 promoter allows the expression of the lacZ reporter gene in M. tuberculosis H37Rv but that this expression is completely abolished when Mce3R is overexpressed in the H37Rv strain from a multi-copy plasmid [13].
Although these findings constitute initial evidence demonstrating the role of Mce3R as a repressor of the mce3 operon transcription, the presence of an endogenous copy of the mce3R gene in M. tuberculosis did not enable us to determine the conditions in which the regulator system operates.

Here, in order to compare the expression the mce3 operon either in the absence or in the presence of Mce3R, DNA fusions of the mce3 promoter to lacZ reporter, containing or not containing mce3R were cloned within pYUB178-lacZ.
The resulting plasmids, pP3-mce3R and pP3 respectively, were integrated into the chromosome of the Deltamce3R strain.
The beta-galactosidase activity was measured at different points along cultures of M. tuberculosis grown in vitro and in a macrophages cell line.
Since transcription of mce3 genes has previously shown to be increased when M. tuberculosis was grown in rich media [10-12] the expression of mce3 operon was assessed in both synthetic (7H9) and rich (Dubos) media (Figure 3 and data not shown).

While hardly any beta-galactosidase activity was detected either in in vitro cultures (Fig. 3) or in cell-line mice macrophages (Table 1) in the presence of Mce3R (Deltamce3R::pP3-mce3R strain), the activity in the Deltamce3R::pP3 strain was remarkably high in all of the conditions tested.
The promoter activity increased along the in vitro cultures of Deltamce3R:: pP3, and peaked at 24 h of infection inside the cell.
These results clearly indicate that Mce3R represses the expression of mce3 operon in M. tuberculosis in the growth conditions tested.



Assessment of the role of Mce3R in the transcription of the four mce operons

A number of reports indicate that the expression of all mce genes depends on the growth conditions [10-12].
These observations, together with the findings that regulatory proteins are involved in the expression of the mce1 and mce3 operons, suggested the idea of a broader regulatory mechanism differentially controlling the expression of mce genes.
In order to test whether Mce3R is able to control the transcription of the other mce operons apart from mce3, the expression of one gene from each mce operon in the mutant strain was compared with that of the wild type.
Primers were designed to amplify a 189, 168, 234, 151 and 134 bp region on mce1D (Rv0172), mce2A (Rv0589), mce3E (Rv1970), mce4A (Rv3499), and sigA respectively.
Amplicons of expected size were obtained with each pair of primers (data not shown).

Differences in relative gene expression between the wild type and the mutant strains were assessed in group means for statistical significance by a randomisation test (see Materials and Methods).
While the relative abundance of mce3E mRNA was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.030) in the mutant than in the wild type strain in the conditions evaluated, no significant differences between both strains were observed on the expression of mce1D (P &lt; 0.74), mce2A (P &lt; 0.918) and mce4A (P &lt; 0.511) (Fig 4).

To verify that RNA samples were not contaminated with genomic DNA, RT-PCR reactions were performed without the addition of reverse transcriptase.
The lack of amplification products verifies that the RT-PCR products were amplified from RNA that had been reversely transcribed into cDNA.

These results demonstrate that Mce3R regulates exclusively the transcription of mce3 operon among mce genes in the conditions tested



Mce3R expression is self regulated

To investigate whether mce3R is subject to transcriptional autoregulation, a transcriptional fusion was constructed between the mce3R promoter and the lacZ reporter.
Since mce3R is located adjacent to mce3 operon and divergently oriented, the mce3R promoter is situated in mce3R-yrbE3A intergenic region.
The entire intergenic region was fused to the lacZ gene within pYUB178-lacZ to create plasmid pPR3-lacZ.
The pPR3-lacZ plasmid was transformed into the wild type M. tuberculosis H37Rv and the M. tuberculosis Deltamce3R mutant, and beta-galactosidase activity was measured to assess the levels of mce3R promoter activity with and without Mce3R regulator.
As shown in figure 5, in the presence of Mce3R (wild type H37Rv strain) the activity of mce3R promoter is steadily and significantly reduced as compared with that in the absence of the Mce3R regulator (mutant Deltamce3R strain).
This reduction in mce3R promoter activity was more evident during the stationary growth phase.
These experiments demonstrate that the Mce3R protein is able to transcriptionally repress expression of the mce3R promoter in M. tuberculosis during the in vitro culture condition tested.

Phenotypic analyses of the fur mutant

A deletion mutant of Fur was constructed from wild-type S. oneidensis strain MR-1.
The fur mutant formed smaller colonies than wild-type strain after two days' incubation at 30 degrees C (Fig. 1), suggestive of a growth deficiency caused by Fur inactivation.
Moreover, colonies of the fur mutant appeared paler in color than MR-1 colonies.
Wild-type S. oneidensis colonies have characteristic reddish or pink pigments, which is attributed to high heme content in the cells [17].
The pale color of colonies of the fur mutant suggested that there was less heme, presumably due to the low level of intracellular iron as a heme co-factor.
The low level of intracellular iron has been documented in an E. coli fur mutant [26].

To test the role of Fur in the response of S. oneidensis to iron, we grew the fur mutant and the wild-type strain in LB medium with different concentrations of the iron chelator 2, 2'-dipyridyl to create iron depletion conditions.
LB medium contains ~17 uM iron, hence it is considered as an iron-rich medium [26].
In LB, the fur mutant displayed longer lag phase, slower growth rate at logarithmic phase and lower cell density at stationary phase than MR-1 (Fig. 2).
When iron was depleted from the growth medium by addition of iron chelator, both strains clearly displayed growth inhibition.
Interestingly, when both strains were grown with 160 uM iron chelator, no significant difference was detected between the mutant and MR-1.
With 240 uM iron chelator, the fur mutant displayed a much shorter lag phase than MR-1 and reached a higher cell density at stationary phase, suggesting that the fur mutant better tolerated the iron depletion stress.

Fur is a pleiotropic transcriptional factor controlling the expression of both iron-regulated and non-iron-regulated genes [9].
Fur has been implicated in acid tolerance response, since E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium harboring fur mutations are acid-sensitive [27,28].
Therefore, the acid tolerance of S. oneidensisfur mutant was examined.
Wild-type and the fur mutant were grown in LB medium buffered at pH5.5 and 7 (Fig. 3).
At pH of 5.5, the fur mutant but not wild-type strain had severe growth defect, demonstrating that the fur mutant was more sensitive to acidic condition.



Microarray experiments

For microarray experiments, mid-log phase grown fur mutant was treated with iron chelator for one hour and then ferrous sulfate.
The concentration of 160 uM iron chelator was used for iron depletion during the microarray experiments because growth was clearly inhibited, but not completely abolished at this concentration (Fig. 2).
Samples were collected at multiple time points during iron depletion and repletion and used for global transcriptomic analyses.
To allow for comparison of any pairs of samples, S. oneidensis genomic DNA was used as a common reference in each microarray experiment (see Methods and Materials for details).
This strategy has been successfully employed in several studies [29-32].
In addition, since S. oneidensisfur mutant in previous studies was generated from a rifampin-resistant strain (DSP10) instead of wild-type S. oneidensis MR-1, we decided to repeat the microarray comparison between the fur mutant and wild-type under aerobic condition, using the fur mutant derived from MR-1.
Therefore, MR-1 was grown in LB to mid-logarithmic phase, RNA was prepared and used for microarray experiments.
This allowed for comparison of gene expression profiles of the fur mutant and MR-1 (see below).
To evaluate the reliability of microarray data, quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a few selected genes (Additional file Additional file 1).
A high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.92 was observed between RT-PCR and microarray results.



Fur-regulated genes

Global gene expression profiles of the fur mutant and MR-1 grown in LB medium were compared.
A total number of 118 and 56 genes were significantly up- and down- regulated, respectively (Fig. 4).
As commonly seen in microarray datasets, a large portion of up- or down-regulated genes corresponded to genes with unknown function, indicating a much broader modulon than deduced by gene annotation alone.
Among the genes with defined functions (Table 1), two groups of genes were most noticeable: genes encoding iron acquisition proteins and ribosome proteins.
The high level induction of iron acquisition genes agreed with the expected role of Fur in regulating iron uptake and transport.
It provided an explanation for the better growth of the fur mutant under iron-depleted condition (Fig. 2), since the up-regulation of iron acquisition genes imposed an advantage for rapid adaptation to the iron depletion.
The induction of genes encoding ribosomal proteins was rather unexpected, as the fur mutant grown in LB medium displayed growth defects.
It was possible that these genes were induced to accommodate the requirement to synthesize iron acquisition proteins induced by iron depletion.
Alternatively, their induction could be due to cellular response to overcome the growth deficiency in LB.
Notably, a conserved Fur binding motif could be identified in the promoter region of almost all of the iron acquisition genes in Table 1, while no ribosome subunit gene except SO0232 had a Fur binding motif in its promoter (data not shown).
Therefore, it was likely that genes encoding ribosome proteins were not the direct targets of Fur.
Lastly, several acid resistance systems have been characterized in gamma-proteobacteria [33,34].
However, expression of components of these systems (e.g. Crp, RpoS, glutamate-, arginine- and lysine-decarboxylases) was not significantly altered in the fur mutant.
Since the acid tolerance of the fur mutant was reduced, it was possible that these genes were regulated at post-transcriptional level, or the core components of these systems were not yet annotated in S. oneidensis, or S. oneidensis could employ a novel and yet unidentified mechanism for acid tolerance response.



Iron-responsive and Fur-independent biological processes

The microarray analyses of the fur mutant indicated that fewer genes was significantly regulated at early time points than later in both iron depletion and repletion, and there were more down regulated genes than up regulated genes during iron depletion (Fig. 5A).
Few genes encoding iron acquisition or ribosome proteins were among those up or down regulated, suggesting that their regulation was strictly Fur-dependent.
Meanwhile, a group of genes related to anaerobic energy transport was repressed by iron depletion (Fig. 5B), but not identified in Fur regulon shown above (Table 1).
Therefore, this process was iron responsive but Fur independent.
These genes include formate dehydrogenase and multiple c-type cytochromes that are involved in anaerobic energy respiration.
For example, FccA is a fumarate reductase; CymA is a key protein controlling respiration with a variety of electron acceptors, while MtrC/OmcB is an outer membrane protein required for metal reduction.
A logical explanation of the repression by iron is that under the tested condition, these genes are non-essential, iron-using proteins.
Upon iron depletion, they are repressed to release previously sequestrated iron to increase free intracellular iron pool.
This mechanism has been well documented in E. coli[4,35] as mediated by Fur and a small RNA RyhB.
However, in S. oneidensis this biological process must be controlled by iron-responsive regulator(s) other than Fur.
Another notable iron-responsive and Fur-independent process was aerobic energy transport, including TCA cycle enzymes malate dehydrogenase (Mdh), succinate dehydrogenase (SdhC), isocitrate dehydrogenase (SO1538) and citrate synthase (GltA).
Other related genes include succinylarginine dihydrolase(AstB) and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Ivd).
Notably, in contrast to the genes involved in anaerobic energy transport, these genes were induced by iron depletion (Fig. 5C), suggesting that it was more energy-consuming for coping with iron starvation than the energetic need for normal growth.



Gene co-expression network

Genes with the highest fold changes are not necessarily the most important genes for a given condition, since there usually is a dissociation between gene expression and physiological phenotype [36].
Moreover, a large number of significantly regulated genes are linked to hypothetical proteins.
To gain more insights into their functions, a gene co-expression network was constructed (Additional file Additional file 2A).
Microarray data have frequently been used for gene annotation based on the observation that genes with similar expression patterns are more likely to be functionally related, that is, "guilt by association", despite the fact that co-expression does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship at the transcriptional level.
This fact is exploited in the "majority-rule" method of network annotation in which a gene is annotated based on the most commonly occurring functions of its co-expressed partners.

Functionally related genes were indeed grouped together in all clusters of the gene network that we constructed (Additional file Additional file 2A).
For example, one cluster contains eleven genes encoding heat shock proteins (DnaK, DnaJ, HslV, HslU, HtpG, Lon, SecB, PrlC, ClpB, GroEL and GroES) and three unknown genes (Fig. 6A).
These heat shock proteins function to accelerate turnovers of denatured or unfolded proteins and respond to multiple stress conditions [37].
Their identification in this study is expected since lack of iron as protein cofactor would impair the functionality of a number of proteins.
Furthermore, it can be predicted based on the cluster that the unknown genes in this cluster might function in stress response.
This prediction is further supported by their operon structures.
SO4161 is immediately upstream of heat shock HslU and HslV and might form an operon together.
Similarly, SO2017 could form another operon with the upstream gene encoding heat shock protein HtpG.
Finally, when the Gibbs Motif Sampler [38] was employed to search the promoter regions of genes in this cluster for common sequence motif(s), a conserved RpoH (sigma32) binding site was identified (Fig. 6A).
In E. coli, RpoH directs the RNAP holoenzymes to specifically transcribed genes encoding heat shock proteins.
Its presence in the promoter regions of SO2017 and SO4161 provides further evidence that these two genes play a role in stress response.

Another large cluster contains many c-type cytochromes (e.g. CymA, MtrA, MtrC and OmcA) and their related genes such as heme exporters and alcohol dehydrogenases (Fig. 6B).
Many of them were considered as iron-responsive but Fur-independent, as discussed in the previous section.
When the Gibbs Motif Sampler was applied, a palindromic sequence of "AAATGTGATCNNGNTCACA NTT" (Fig. 6B) was identified with statistical significance.
This sequence is almost identical to the known binding motif of an E. coli global transcriptional factor Crp (AAATGTGATCTAGATCACA TTT) [39].
In S. oneidensis, crp mutants are deficient in reducing Fe(III), Mn(IV), nitrate, fumarate and DMSO as electron acceptors [40].
The identification of a highly conserved Crp-binding site at the promoters of genes in this cluster provides an explanation for the phenotypes of crp mutants.
Crp might act as a master regulator of anaerobic energy transport; its inactivation leads to repression of multiple branches of anaerobic energy transport pathway.
Notably, the regulation of Crp to anaerobic energy transport is iron-responsive but Fur-independent, since most genes in this cluster shows little expression difference between the fur mutant and wild-type.

Sequence analysis of known HapR targets and orthologs

The V. cholerae quorum-sensing regulator HapR is a TetR-family protein that functions both as an activator and as a repressor.
Quorum sensing in V. cholerae has been demonstrated to regulate a variety of cellular functions, but HapR-binding sites have only been determined for two targets thus far: aphA and hapR itself.
It has been shown that HapR binds to a site from 61 to 82 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site in the aphA promoter (19) and to a site 12 to 33 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site for hapR (20).
It is likely that autoregulation of HapR along with virulence regulation via AphA are conserved across the Vibrios, in which case the corresponding binding sites should show strong conservation across species.
Thus, we carried out a multiple sequence alignment of orthologous regions across closely related Vibrio species for aphA and its orthologs as well as for hapR and its orthologs.
As noted, a previous study had shown that the binding regions upstream of hapR and aphA show only weak conservation when the direct strands are compared (20) To check for similarity in the binding sites when the complementary strands are also considered, we performed a sequence alignment of the direct strand in the region upstream of aphA with the complementary strand to the region upstream of hapR.
The alignment results showed that the binding regions for both genes are quite similar when the complementary strand is also considered (see Supplementary Data, Figure S1), indicating that bioinformatic procedures can be used to represent the corresponding binding motif as discussed further below.

The upstream regions of aphA orthologs and hapR orthologs were then aligned, taking the complementary strands into account, in order to identify a consensus binding sequence.
A notable feature of the conserved binding regions (Table 1) is that for a subset of the genes (specifically hapR orthologs opaR, luxR, smcR and litR), it is possible to identify a conserved region with dyad symmetry similar to the binding sites that have recently been identified for HapR orthologs in Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio harveyi (29,30).
These sites are highlighted in Table 1 under the heading Motif 1.
A more striking observation is that the binding sites for aphA and its orthologs and for hapR do not follow the same pattern.
While the initial sequence of the binding sites of these genes are similar to those in Motif 1, the concluding sequence does not show the corresponding dyad symmetry and has the absolutely conserved sequence 'TGT' instead of the Motif 1 consensus 'AATAR' (where R represents A/G).
Binding sites following this second pattern are referred to as Motif 2 sites (Table 1).
Since HapR is able to activate the V. harveyi luminescence operon, which is a direct target of the HapR ortholog, LuxR, we reasoned that these binding sites in closely related species can be used to construct a preliminary representation of binding motifs for HapR itself (6).
Thus, the preliminary analysis identifies potential HapR-binding sites and indicates that there are two distinct HapR binding motifs.


The above observations are further strengthened when we consider additional V. cholerae genes that are known to be regulated by HapR, but for which specific binding sites have not yet been identified.
These targets include hapA (31) which encodes the protease HapA and 3 genes which encode GGDEF and/or GGDEF/EAL domain proteins: vc0900, vc2370 and vca0080 (21).
We identified potential HapR binding sites for these genes by searching their upstream regions for patterns similar to Motif 1 or Motif 2.
Specifically, Motif 1-binding sites were identified for vc0900, vc2370 and vca0080 and a Motif 2-binding site was identified upstream of hapA.
These sites were included in the initial list of predicted HapR-binding sites (Table 1).
It is interesting to note that all the known targets listed in Table 1 with Motif 1-binding sites contain the motif AATAR.
In some cases (e.g. litR), there are multiple contiguous occurrences of this motif, in which case the proposed binding site is taken to end at the last occurrence of the AATAR motif.
It is noteworthy that for Motif 1 targets listed in Table 1 with a single AATAR concluding motif, the distance between the initial conserved sequence and the concluding AATAR sequence is variable and thus, Motif 1-binding sites appear to be of variable length.
As we discuss in the following sections, characterization of the HapR-binding motif according to the two categories outlined in Table 1 leads to testable predictions for novel target genes regulated by HapR.
A schematic flowchart outlining the procedure followed is shown in the Supplementary Data (Figure S2).



Motif 1 target predictions

Analysis of the Motif 1-binding sites listed in Table 1 reveals that the motif can be characterized by: (i) an initial 7 bp conserved region represented by the motif YWATTKA (where Y stands for C/T, W stands for A/T, and K stands for G/T); (ii) followed by a region of variable length which is typically AT-rich; and (iii) concluding with the sequence AATAR.
This motif is similar to the binding motif recently identified for HapR orthologs in V. vulnificus and V. harveyi, but an important distinction is that our analysis considers the binding length to be variable.
Note that while the initial conserved sequence can be summarized by YWATTKA, this would include sequences (e.g. CAATTTA) which are not observed in any of the known targets listed in Table 1.
A more restrictive constraint for the initial 7-bp sequence is that it corresponds to one of the three patterns represented by YTATTGA, TAATTGA or YTATTTA.
We carried out a genome-wide search for genes whose upstream regions include a potential binding site satisfying the constraints noted above.
Since the binding region can be variable in length, we considered binding sites ranging from 16 to 22 bp.
In some cases, there are multiple occurrences of the motif AATAR, so the length of the spacer region between the conserved elements at the ends is not well defined (Figure 1A).
Nevertheless, even if we consider only those targets with a single occurrence of the concluding motif AATAR, the length of the binding site is seen to vary over the entire range considered (i.e. from 16 to 22 bp).
The genome-wide search for potential binding sites yielded 33 intergenic regions.
For each binding site length, we picked one to two candidate genes for experimental validation.
These genes, along with their predicted binding sites, are shown in Figure 1A.
(Note that for the 16-bp targets, we considered targets with 1-bp mutations compared to the patterns noted above, since searching for the exact patterns yielded only one hypothetical gene as a predicted target.)
As discussed below, all of the targets listed in Figure 1A were subsequently validated by gel retardation assays.
The functions of the regulated target genes along with predictions for the corresponding operons are provided in Table S1.
These results demonstrate that the proposed sequence pattern is an effective way of representing a binding motif for HapR and further indicate that there are many more genes that are potentially regulated by HapR.




Motif 2 target predictions

Unlike binding sites corresponding to Motif 1, Motif 2-binding sites contain a strongly conserved 16-bp region that ends with the sequence TGT.
This suggests that Motif 2-binding sites can be represented using a PSWM corresponding to a 16-bp binding site.
Accordingly, the predicted Motif 2-binding sites (listed in Table 1) were used to generate a preliminary PSWM.
This PSWM was used to score potential binding sites in the upstream regions of all genes in the V. cholerae genome.
We also specifically considered genes which were shown to be differentially regulated in a hapR mutant as compared to WT in previous microarray studies (7).
The five highest-scoring novel binding sites in the whole-genome scan and the highest-scoring target also identified in microarray data (vca0880) were chosen for experimental validation.
The predicted targets and the corresponding HapR-binding sites are listed in Figure 1B.
Target protein function and operon predictions are provided in Table S1.
As discussed further in the experimental results, all the predicted targets except one (vc0241) were validated by gel retardation assays.
The binding sites for the experimentally validated targets were used to generate a revised PSWM for HapR based solely on targets in V. cholerae.
Using the revised PSWM to scan the V. cholerae genome, additional predictions for high-scoring target genes were made.
Out of these, three additional genes were chosen (based on PSWM scores and microarray data) for further experimental validation.
All three target genes were confirmed experimentally, and the corresponding binding sites are listed in Figure 1B.
It is noteworthy that while the 7-bp initial region of Motif 2-binding sites (with consensus sequence YTATTGA) is similar to the corresponding region in Motif 1-binding sites, the concluding sequence for Motif 2-binding sites is strongly conserved (TGT) and distinct from Motif 1-binding sites (AATAR).
Furthermore, alignment of the predicted binding regions (Figure 1B) shows minimal conservation beyond the 16-bp region ending with TGT, indicating the Motif 2-binding sites have a fixed binding length of 16 bp and do not exhibit the dyad symmetry typical of Motif 1-binding sites.
Our results thus provide evidence for two distinct binding motifs for HapR and have led to the identification of novel targets of HapR corresponding to each motif as described further below.



HapR binds to the promoter regions of newly identified targets

In order to test whether HapR protein can bind to the putative target promoters containing either Motif 1 or Motif 2-binding sites, an MBP-HapR fusion was constructed.
This tagged HapR protein was able to complement a hapR deletion mutant when using the HapR-activated heterologous luxCDABE operon from V. harveyi as a bioluminescent reporter (data not shown).
For each promoter region that was tested, a 300 - 400-bp region containing the binding site was PCR amplified and radiolabeled.
Gel retardation assays were performed to detect binding of the MBP-HapR protein to each of the promoter regions.
MBP-HapR bound to all 11 of the tested promoters containing a Motif 1-binding site and all but one (vc0241) of the eight promoters containing a Motif 2-binding site (Figure 2) Thus, the Motif 1-binding sequence reliably predicts promoter regions capable of being bound by HapR.
The original Motif 2 PSWM also predicts HapR-binding sites fairly accurately, and it was further refined based on experimentally validated targets.




HapR activates or represses expression from newly identified target promoters

The above gel retardation analysis suggests that the target genes validated experimentally are directly regulated by HapR.
In order to test whether regulation by HapR results in activation or repression of transcription for these genes, transcriptional lux fusions were constructed.
PCR products used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were cloned upstream of luxCDABE in the pBBR-lux reporter plasmid.
Many of these promoters are not functional in Escherichia coli (data not shown).
Therefore, the resulting constructs were transformed into wild-type and hapR-deleted strains of V. cholerae, which is their native host.
Some binding sites were located between divergently transcribed genes, so these promoters were cloned into the lux reporter in both orientations.
All the promoters showed either activation or repression by HapR ranging from ~2-fold to almost 80-fold (Figure 3).
For three of the binding sites located between divergently transcribed genes (vca0246/7, vc0166/7 and vca0182/3), HapR was able to repress expression from the promoters when they were oriented in either direction.
On the other hand, for the binding site located between vc2634 and vc2635, HapR only repressed expression from the promoter when it was oriented in the same direction as vc2635, while it had no effect on expression in the other direction.
A control plasmid containing Plac-luxCDABE displayed similar Lux activity in wild-type and hapR mutants (data not shown).
Therefore, HapR is not only able to bind to promoters containing the Motif 1 or Motif 2 consensus binding sequences, but it is also able to affect transcription levels of genes expressed from these promoters.




Validation of the PSWM for Motif 2

The consensus binding sequence of the HapR ortholog in V. harveyi, LuxR, was studied in detail in a recent paper (30).
Since this binding sequence is similar to Motif 1, we focused on a Motif 2-binding site for further analysis in this study.
Single-point mutations were made within the Motif 2-binding sequence located in the promoter region of vca0880 to validate the PSWM for Motif 2.
The promoter of vca0880 was chosen because it is bound and activated very strongly by HapR (Figures 2 and 3), and would thus allow for better resolution of the binding abilities of various point mutants.
EMSAs were performed to determine the extent of binding of MBP-HapR to a 60-bp fragment of the promoter region of vca0880 containing the Motif 2 consensus binding sequence as well as to six other versions of the fragment, each with a different single-point mutation.
DNA fragments containing the desired point mutations were generated by hybridizing complementary oligonucleotides.
A fragment lacking the entire consensus binding site (Delta16) was used as a negative control.
As can be seen in Figure 4A, MBP-HapR bound to the wild-type fragment with a fairly high affinity while it was unable to bind to a fragment that was lacking the consensus binding site.
It should be noted, however, that the difference in length due to binding site deletion could impact DNA stiffness, which in turn could potentially be an important factor for HapR binding.
Each point mutation affected HapR-binding affinity to varying degrees, and our results agree with the PSWM in that a mutation at position 9, which is not highly conserved across binding sites known to be bound by HapR, affected HapR binding affinity the least out of all the tested mutations, and in fact, bound to HapR almost as well as the wild-type sequence did.
The other point mutations altered highly conserved nucleotides, and thus affected HapR binding to a greater degree (Figure 4B and C).
The T5A mutation resulted in significant loss of binding, which is consistent with the negative EMSA for the vc0241 promoter, which also contains the same T5A mutation.
The G6C mutation also led to a significant loss of binding, which is consistent with previous studies of HapR binding to the aphA promoter (19).
While the G15C mutation had a less significant effect on HapR binding than might have been expected based on the PSWM, the change was still more deleterious than the A9G mutation.
The T14A mutation had a strong effect on HapR binding, and a previous study (20) showed that the single change, T16C, prevents HapR binding.
This suggests that the 'TGT' motif is important for HapR binding, although the G15C mutation by itself does not have a strong effect on HapR binding.
Taken together, these results suggest that the PSWM that was constructed based on confirmed binding sites is reasonably accurate in terms of the importance of each base's contribution to HapR binding.

Transcriptional response of the nitrogen metabolism genes to phosphate limitation

We previously reported that phosphate limitation upregulated nitrogen metabolism genes in the DeltaphoP mutant (23).
Microarray results showed that glutamine synthetase gene glnII and genes of the operon amtB-glnK-glnD increased their transcription in response to phosphate downshift in the DeltaphoP mutant, while no change was detected in the wild-type strain.
The GlnA protein, detected in 2D gels, was overproduced in the DeltaphoP mutant.
These expression responses suggested that PhoP might be exerting a negative effect on expression of those nitrogen metabolism genes.

Inspection of the nucleotide sequences of the promoter regions indicated the presence of PHO-like sequences in the above mentioned nitrogen structural genes and in the glnR regulator gene.
This suggested that the previously observed transcriptomic profiles were due to both direct and indirect regulation by PhoP.
The direct control was checked by DNA-binding analysis of the glnA, glnII and amtB promoters using the purified DNA-binding domain of the PhoP response regulator (GST-PhoPDBD) (8).
The promoter regions of the two regulatory genes, glnR and glnRII, were also analysed to explore a possible indirect control of the structural genes.



PhoP binds the glnR promoter but not the glnRII one

The glnR 5'-region was cloned by PCR as a fragment of 362 bp that also included 98 bp of the upstream coding sequence (CDS).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) of this fragment with the GST-PhoPDBD protein revealed the formation of three retarded bands (Figure 1).
As reported previously (11), each retarded DNA - protein complex correspond to a number of protein monomers bound to the DNA fragment.
The established model of the PhoP-binding site indicates that each PhoP monomer binds a direct repeat unit (DRu) of 11 nt.
Two or three consecutive DRus form the core of the binding site.
Once the core is occupied, further protein monomers can bind adjacent DRus, what account for the DNA - protein complexes of lower electrophoretic mobility (see the detailed analysis below).


To locate the PhoP-binding site, we carried out DNase I footprinting experiments.
Electrophoretic separation of digestion products was facilitated by using a smaller fragment of 257 bp that comprised only the glnR promoter sequence.
The GST-PhoPDBD protein at a concentration of 2 muM protected from DNase I digestion a stretch of 33 nt located at positions -139 to -107 in the coding strand (all coordinates are referred to the translation start site; Figure 2A).
This stretch comprised a DRu with sequence matching the first seven PHO box consensus bases (GTTCACC).
In addition, some upstream and downstream nucleotides were protected to a lesser extent by protein binding.
As previously observed in other PhoP footprintings (11), DNase I hypersensitive sites appeared next to the binding site at its 3'-end.
The complementary strand showed protection from -112 to -140 nt, partial protections up to position -103, and hypersensitive sites at positions -144 and -145 (Figure 2B).


The promoter region of glnR contains three transcription start sites at positions -200, -170 to -168 and -119, which correspond to promoters P3, P2 and P1, respectively (21).
Promoter P3 is active only during the exponential phase, whereas transcriptions originated from P2 and P1 promoters are detected at both exponential and stationary phases (31).
Fink et al. (19) reported that only P2 and P3 are active in conditions of nitrogen limitation.
The PhoP protection covers the distal P1 transcription start (Figure 3A).
Thus, binding of PhoP probably blocks the glnR expression whatever promoter is active.


Although computer searches of the promoter region of the second nitrogen regulatory gene glnRII did not reveal any conserved PHO DRu, we examined it for PhoP binding.
Even at 1 muM of protein, the EMSA results did not show any binding under conditions identical to those used for glnR (Figure 1; see 'Discussion' section).



PhoP-binding sites overlap the GlnR boxes in both glutamine synthetase genes glnA and glnII

The 5' sequences of the two glutamine synthetase genes of S. coelicolor were amplified by PCR.
The cloned glnA fragment comprised the intergenic sequence (-220 to +16) and 36 bp of the upstream opposite CDS.
The glnII fragment contained the full promoter region of 136 bp plus the last 105 bp of the upstream CDS.
Both fragments were able to bind PhoP since they gave shifted bands in EMSA.

The glnAp gave a clear shifted band and a weak one of lower electrophoretic mobility (I and II, respectively; Figure 1).
The footprinting assay of the glnA coding strand revealed a protected region extending from -142 to -114 and partial protection of nucleotides -111 and -110 (Figure 2C).
The same region was protected in the complementary strand, from -142 to -108, although a hypersensitive site was evident at nucleotide -113 (Figure 2D).
This protected region comprises the first and half of the second GlnR box that have been described in the glnA promoter (22).
The GlnR boxes have been defined as composed of two conserved sequences of 5 nt separated by 6 variable nt (22) (see also Figure 3B - E).
GlnR function as a transcriptional activator of glnA (19,22).
Binding of PhoP at the glnA promoter region is likely to interfere with GlnR binding and possibly with RNA polymerase function since the glnA transcription start site is located at position -74 (20) (Figure 3B).

The gel mobility shift assays of the glnII promoter revealed three clear DNA - protein complexes.
Complexes II and III showed stronger retardation (lower mobility) than complex I, and also showed a higher signal intensity (Figure 1).

As shown in Figure 2E and F, the GST-PhoPDBD protein protected a large nt stretch of the glnII promoter from DNase I digestion, extending from -145 to -88 in the coding strand, and from -138 to -84 in the complementary strand.
In contrast to the glnA sequence, the coding strand of glnII exhibited a well-conserved DRu (Figure 3D).
Also, the large protected nt stretch completely covers the two GlnR boxes described by Tiffert et al. (22).
Two closely placed promoters have been described in the glnII gene.
The main promoter should correspond to the major vegetative sigma factor and its transcription start site is the adenine -79.
The minor promoter shows putative elements of sigma31 (14).
This sigma factor, which is more active at stationary phase, recognizes promoters of actIII (an actinorhodin structural gene) and of hrdD (a homologue of Escherichia coli rpoD), and also the glnR P2 promoter (31).
As shown in Figure 3D, the overlapping location of promoters and binding sites indicate that PhoP may repress glnII transcription interfering with both GlnR binding and promoter activity.



The promoter for the amtB-glnK-glnD operon contains separated PhoP and GlnR operators

The amtB gene encodes a putative ammonium transporter and forms an operon with glnK and glnD, which encode the PII protein and the PII nucleotidyl transferase respectively (18,19).
The latter two proteins may be considered nitrogen metabolism sensors.
Using RT - PCR experiments and a glnR mutant, Tiffert et al. (22) showed that GlnR activates the transcription of the amtB gene.

EMSA analyses of the DNA fragment containing the amtB 5'-region (-285 to +4) showed a clear shifted band and a second weak one with lower mobility (Figure 1).
The DNase I protection of this fragment extended from -186 to -152 in the coding strand what contained a conserved DRu (Figure 2G).
Results for the complementary strand showed a protected stretch from -142 to -170, and partial protection of the nucleotides -175 and -177 (Figure 2H).

In contrast to what we have found for the GS genes, the PhoP-binding site at the amtB promoter is placed upstream and separated from the GlnR boxes (Figure 3E).
Three separated promoters (P3 to P1) have been identified in the amtB upstream region by low resolution S1 analysis (19).
In principle, the location of the P1 transcription start site (-76 to -73, Figure 3E) suggests that PhoP does not control this promoter but the upstream ones P3 and P2.
In this case PhoP might act as a 'road-block' preventing the expression from the upstream promoters.



Analysis of the complex operator structures

The PhoP-binding sites are formed by direct repeats units (DRu) of 11 nt, each one bound by a protein monomer.
We have recently described the structures of DRus based on the 'information theory' analysis and on combined EMSA and footprinting results (11).
The differentiated structures served to classify the PHO operators into three groups.
Operators that produce a unique retarded band in EMSA are either class I, if formed by 2 DRus (i.e. one PHO box), or class II, if composed of three DRus.
More frequently (as occurs in all cases reported here) PhoP binding produces two or more retarded bands in EMSA.
Those sites belong to class III and comprise two or three conserved DRus that form the core of the site, and one or several DRus that extend the protein occupancy beyond the core.

Figure 3 includes the summary of the footprinting results.
The protected regions were analysed by the sequence walker method (29) using the Model 1 matrix (11).
In each walker, the letter height represents the conservation of the base and its contribution to the information content of the site (Ri value).
Base conservation correlates with the number of contacts to the protein (32), and, when displayed as walkers, serves to identify the binding sequence.

The protected region in the glnR promoter comprised three DRus, and a partially protected fourth one (Figure 3A).
The proposed DRu structure explains the formation of the three observed complexes in EMSA (Figure 1).
A similar operator structure was observed in the phytase gene (SCO7697) (11).

The PhoP-binding site in the glnA promoter showed a less evident interpretation.
In the coding strand a class II structure was suggested.
This implies that the glnAp fragment should yield a unique retarded complex.
Nevertheless, a second faint band appeared above the major retarded band in EMSA (Figure 1).
Moreover, the highest conserved DRu is poorly protected, and the total Ri for this structure is negative (-1.3 bits, Figure 3B).
When an accurate binding model is used, it has been demonstrated that the Ri value must be positive (29).
In the complementary strand a more plausible structure was found because the core sequences show a low but positive Ri (0.2 bits), they were completely protected, and the two retarded bands can be explained (Figure 3C).
The large protected sequence in the glnII promoter included five DRus (Figure 3D) that account for the formation of the three EMSA complexes.

The PhoP protected region in the amtB promoter covered a well conserved DRu that is flanked by two poorly conserved DRus.
The two observed EMSA complexes indicate a structure composed of a 2 DRu core plus an extension repeat.
The degree of protection and the walkers served us to decide which of the flanking DRus forms part of the core (Figure 3E).



Reporter studies: PhoP represses the transcription of nitrogen genes

In order to quantify the effect of PhoP on expression of the nitrogen-regulated genes, glnR, glnA, glnII and amtB promoter regions were cloned in pLUXAR+neo driving expression of the luxAB reporter gene.
The resulting integrative plasmids pAR-N2 (glnRp), pAR-N4 (glnAp), pAR-N6 (glnIIp), pAR-N8 (amtBp) were introduced by conjugation into the wild-type M145 strain and into the INB201 (DeltaphoP) mutant.
Plasmids are stably maintained by integration into the Streptomyces chromosome PhiC31 attB site.

Cultures were grown in MG-3.2 medium (containing 3.2 mM phosphate), using three independent replicates.
The cultures showed a diauxic growth with transition phase from 45 to 51 h that triggered the onset of antibiotic production; the DeltaphoP mutant showed reduced growth as described in Santos-Beneit et al. (25).

Using these reporter constructions it was clearly observed that the four promoter regions were repressed by PhoP since reporter enzyme higher activities were observed in the DeltaphoP mutant with respect to parental strain at all sampling times (Figure 4A - D).
The reporter expression patterns, varied among the promoters assayed.
Thus, compared to the other assayed promoters (of phosphate transporter genes pstS, pitH1 and pitH2, and of glycerophosphodiesterase genes glpQ1 and glpQ2) [(23,25), Santos-Beneit, unpublished] the promoter region of the glnR gene produced usual or low activities across the time course of the culture.
Indeed, in the wild-type strain the luminescence signals were below the instrument detection limit at 70 h (Figure 4A).
In contrast, the structural glnA, glnII and amtB genes appeared to have very strong promoters.
Among these, glnIIp showed the highest activities in the wild-type strain.
Besides, maximum activities of the different promoters were reached at distinct growth phases.
In both strains glnRp activities increased until the transition phase (45 h, Figure 4A), and decreased thereafter.
For the glnA and amtB promoter activities, the highest values were at the exponential growth phase in the wild-type (35 h, Figure 4B and D).
The glnIIp showed high activities during the first growth phase and a maximum activity at 42 h (at the initial transition phase, Figure 4C).
In all cases, the wild-type activities dropped rapidly after the transition phase resulting in low values in the stationary phase.
In contrast, deletion of the phoP gene caused slower promoter activity drops, as seen in the INB201 plots (Figure 4A - D).


In summary, we can conclude that PhoP represses directly the transcription of GS genes glnA, glnII, the putative ammonium transporter gene amtB, and the nitrogen regulatory genes glnD and glnK, which form part of the amtB operon.
In addition, PhoP negatively controls these genes via repression of its activator gene glnR.

ColR (PP0901) regulates the expression of PP0903

The expression of genes downstream of colRS operon is regulated by ColR in P. fluorescens [11].
This region of genome is well conserved among Pseudomonas bacteria [5] and therefore we presumed that the operon downstream of colRS (Fig. 1a) could be regulated by ColRS system in P. putida as well.
This downstream operon consists of three genes (Fig. 1a).
The first two, PP0903 coding for a putative methyltransferase and PP0904 coding for a lipopolysaccharide kinase InaA, are conserved among all 15 fully sequenced pseudomonads [5].
Putative orthologs of the third open reading frame PP0905 encoding for a hypothetical protein are present downstream of inaA in 13 sequenced members of Pseudomonas genus.
In order to test whether these genes belong to ColR regulon in P. putida, we cloned the upstream region of PP0903 in front of lacZ gene in a promoter probe plasmid p9TTBlacZ and compared plasmid-encoded beta-galactosidase activities in wild-type P. putida strain PaW85 and in its ColR-deficient derivative.
Our unpublished results show that ColR-dependent phenotypes are more pronounced on solid medium if compared to that in liquid medium.
Therefore, all enzyme activities presented in this study were measured from solid-medium-grown bacteria.
The obtained data showed that ColR is a positive effector of PP0903 expression since beta-galactosidase activity was comparable to the basal level of promoter probe vector p9TTBlacZ in a colR-deficient strain but was 10-fold higher in a wild-type strain (Fig. 1b).
As our previous study showed that ColR-regulated oprQ and algD promoters were affected by phenol [8], the beta-galactosidase activity was also measured in the presence of phenol.
Again, the activity of PP0903 promoter remained indistinguishable from the basal level of vector in the colR-mutant strain (Fig. 1b).
However, phenol significantly enhanced the activity of PP0903 promoter in a wild-type strain where ColR is present (Fig. 1b).
To confirm the role of ColR in the activation of PP0903 promoter, beta-galactosidase measurements were also performed in colR-mutant derivative PaWRtaccolR where the expression of ColR was inducible from Ptac promoter with addition of IPTG.
The activity of PP0903 promoter was already recovered in PaWRtaccolR strain without the induction of colR (Fig. 1b).
This was expected as immunoblot analysis of ColR expression had previously revealed significant leakiness of Ptac promoter in that particular strain [7].
Over-expression of ColR resulted in a strong enhancement of PP0903 promoter over the wild-type level both on glucose and glucose plus phenol medium (Fig. 1b).
Hence, response regulator ColR is indeed necessary for up-regulation of PP0903 promoter in P. putida.
Strong induction of the promoter by ColR over-expression suggests that either the amount of ColR is limiting in the wild-type cells or the ColS-activating signal is low in tested conditions.
Data also imply that the impact of ColR on the PP0903 activation becomes more prominent in bacteria experiencing phenol-caused stress.



ColR binding sites in the promoter regions of oprQ (PP0268) and PP0903

One possible way to find new target genes of a transcriptional regulator is to computationally analyze the whole genome of an organism.
As a certain binding consensus of a transcription factor is needed for that, we aimed to specify the exact binding sites of ColR in the promoters under its control.
Our previous paper demonstrated that purified histidine-tagged ColR bound in vitro to the promoters of oprQ and algD in a gel mobility shift assay [8].
Similar analysis with PP0903 promoter showed that ColR also directly interacts with this promoter DNA.
In order to map the ColR binding sites we performed a DNase I footprinting assay to the DNAs of oprQ, algD and PP0903 promoter fragments labelled with P32.
Fig. 2a illustrates the ColR-recognized regions in the promoters of oprQ and PP0903.
ColR protected a 24-to-26-bp-long area in both promoters (Fig. 2b) depending on a strand analysed.
ColR binding sites reside about 190 and 60 nucleotides upstream of translation start codons of oprQ and PP0903, respectively.
The binding of ColR to PP0903 promoter resulted in the appearance of a hypersensitive site for DNase I just next to the ColR-protected region (Fig. 2a).
Data also showed that the phosphorylated form of ColR (ColR~P) binds to the DNA with higher affinity than the unphosphorylated ColR.
However, the effect of phosphorylation was stronger in case of PP0903 compared to oprQ (Fig. 2a).

Despite the fact that ColR bound to the promoter DNA of algD in a gel mobility shift assay [8] we could not detect a ColR-binding site in this DNA by DNase I footprinting (data not shown).
This suggests that the binding dynamics of response regulator ColR could be somewhat different if algD promoter is compared to the promoters of oprQ and PP0903.
Most probably ColR recognition sequences in the algD promoter diverge from ColR consensus (see Discussion).



Computer search for potential ColR binding sites revealed several new ColR-regulated genes

Comparison of ColR recognition sequences in the promoters of oprQ and PP0903 (Fig. 2b) shows clearly that these two sequences are similar.
The most obvious common feature is a central T-track, 5-bp and 7-bp long in case of oprQ and PP0903, respectively (Fig. 2b).
In total 10 identical nucleotides are present in these two ColR binding sites allowing to deduce a 13-bp-long consensus motif for ColR binding - ACGNNTTTTTNAC.
High similarity of the two ColR binding boxes suggested that a genome-wide computer search could reveal new potential target genes of ColR.
Thus, sequences similar to identified ColR binding sites were searched from the genome of P. putida KT2440 using two free-access web-servers, PredictRegulon [12,13] and Virtual Footprint [14,15].
Several inquiries with varying input sequence length and strand orientation were performed.
Results of both programmes were compared and identical hits were chosen for experimental validation.
Actually, the prediction and identification of new ColR binding sites presented below was a step-by-step process meaning that new predictions were made with every additional confirmed ColR binding site (see Methods).
For experimental evaluation of the computer-predicted putative ColR-regulated promoters, they were cloned into a promoter probe plasmid p9TTBlacZ upstream of the lacZ gene.
If a predicted ColR-binding site was located between two divergently transcribed genes, then this DNA region was cloned upstream of the reporter in both orientations (promoters of PP0035/0036, PP0900/0901 and PP2560/2561).
beta-galactosidase activities were measured in wild-type and ColR-deficient P. putida cells grown overnight on glucose and glucose plus phenol solid media.
Additionally, since promoter activity of PP0903 was strongly enhanced by over-expression of ColR (Fig. 1b) all promoters were tested also in a P. putida strain PaWRtaccolR where the expression of ColR can be induced from Ptac promoter.
Results of beta-galactosidase assay show that promoters of PP0035, PP0036, PP0737, PP0900, PP1636, PP2560 and PP3766 are responsive to the absence and/or to the over-expression of ColR (Fig. 3).
All promoters except PP0737 are positively affected by ColR.
If promoters were tested in the presence of 2.5 mM phenol then the effects of ColR-deficiency and over-expression became more evident in case of most promoters.
For instance, while promoters of PP0036, PP0900, PP1636, PP2560 and PP3766 were only barely affected by the absence of ColR in the glucose-grown cells, then the impact of ColR upon these promoters became obvious in the glucose plus phenol-grown bacteria.
It is also remarkable that all promoters analysed responded significantly more to the over-expression than to the absence of ColR.
Namely, ColR over-expression clearly enhanced the activities of promoters that are under its positive control (Fig. 3).
Especially drastic activation was seen in case of PP0035 where over-expressed ColR caused 30-fold increase in the promoter activity when compared to that in a wild-type strain (Fig 3).
At the same time, the activity of PP0035 promoter was only 3-fold lower in glucose-grown colR mutant than in wild-type.
Analogous to that, the over-expression of ColR lowered the activity of negatively ColR-affected PP0737 promoter about 3-fold but the lack of ColR affected this particular promoter less than 2-fold (Fig. 3).
This data strongly suggest that either ColR amount is limiting in wild-type P. putida to affect significantly the expression of analysed target promoters or the signal perceived and transduced by ColS is low under the conditions employed by us.

It is important to point out that one new ColR-regulated gene, PP0900, locates just upstream of colRS genes and is transcribed divergently from PP0901 encoding colR (Fig. 1a).
Thus, the putative ColR-binding site affecting the expression of PP0900 is actually located between PP0900 and colR.
Analysis of this particular promoter in the direction of colR (PP0901) did not reveal clear ColR-responsiveness under any conditions examined (Fig. 3).
Therefore we conclude that ColR does not auto-regulate its own expression.



ColR binding sites in the promoters of predicted target genes

We aimed to confirm that in silico predicted ColR binding sites upstream of different genes, which expression was ColR-dependent in vivo, could really bind ColR.
For that purpose, we performed a DNase I footprinting analysis to six promoter regions that were tested in a beta-galactosidase assay (Fig. 3).
Figure 4a shows ColR protection patterns of five different promoter regions - PP0035/0036, PP0737, PP0900/0901, PP2560/2561 and PP3766.
The length of ColR-protected area varied between the promoters analysed ranging from 18-bp in one strand of PP0737 up to 46-bp in PP3766 (Fig. 4b).
Phosphorylation of ColR by ColS significantly increased its affinity to DNAs upstream of PP0900/0901, PP2560/2561 and PP3766.
The binding of ColR to several promoter DNAs changed the DNase I digestion pattern revealing new hypersensitive sites for DNase.
Paradoxically, ColR could not affect the DNase I digestion pattern of the PP1636 promoter (data not shown), although, this promoter was influenced by ColR in vivo (Fig. 3) and ColR binding to this DNA was clearly detectable in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 5).
It is noteworthy that the same was seen in case of ColR-regulated algD promoter (see above).
Thus, performed footprint analysis could not reveal all ColR binding sites in the promoters of its target genes.
Nevertheless, data presented in Fig. 4 verifies that ColR indeed binds to the computationally predicted sites in five new ColR-responsive promoters.



ColR binding consensus and potential regulon

The sequences of seven ColR binding sites identified by DNase I footprinting analysis (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4) were aligned to define a more precise ColR binding consensus than initial one, which was deduced only from two binding motifs detected in the promoters of oprQ and PP0903.
The length of the region protected by ColR varied significantly in different promoters (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4).
Therefore, rather long DNA fragments (presented in Table 1) were compared in order to find out whether sequences surrounding the core ColR-recognition site are conserved as well.
Fig. 6 demonstrates a ColR binding consensus created using WebLogo server [16].
In the middle of the sequence a well-conserved 16-bp-long core with 8 totally conserved positions is present, whereas most of the distant positions are much less conserved.
Therefore, only the core region was defined as a final ColR binding consensus ((T/C)(T/C)NA(C/G)NN(T/C)TTTTT(C/G)AC).
Next, this 16-bp-long core was used to predict minimal regulon of ColRS system.
41 ColR binding motif-resembling sites were extracted from P. putida genome by searching the upstream regions (500 bp upstream of the translation start) of all genes using a PredictRegulon server tool.
As several binding sites locate between divergently transcribed genes one may assume that ColR regulon potentially consists of more than 50 different genes (see Additional file 1).
However, whilst the first 11 sites of prediction match perfectly with 7 input sequences, the rest of the matches score lower than the cut-off value (6.76929 in our prediction; see Additional file 1).
Therefore, they should be considered as potential novel ColR sites, which should be confirmed experimentally.
It is notable that three genes (PP1692, PP2322 and PP2323) predicted as ColR-regulated possess two potential ColR-binding sites in their promoter regions (Additional file 1).
There are genes of different functions in the predicted regulon of ColRS two-component system (Additional file 1), but in accordance with previous results, this signal system seems to regulate many membrane associated functions.
Namely, 56% of putative ColR binding sites locate upstream of genes implicated in various membrane functions.
Furthermore, inspection of the first 26 sites shows that even 87% of them locate upstream of genes coding for membrane proteins (Additional file 1).
It is also remarkable that about one third of the putative members of ColR regulon code for hypothetical proteins (Additional file 1).

Construction and characterization of a fur mutant strain

The C. crescentus genome contains two members of the Fur family of metalloregulators, Fur and Zur, putatively involved in iron and zinc homeostasis, respectively, and a Fe-S cluster biogenesis repressor IscR (18); however, no orthologs of iron-responsive regulators present in other alpha-proteobacteria, such as Irr and RirA are found (15).
To determine the role of Fur in C. crescentus, the fur-deleted strain SP0057 was generated by allelic exchange using a suicide vector after a two-step recombination into C. crescentus NA1000 strain.
The absence of the Fur protein in SP0057 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-Fur antiserum, and expression was restored after complementation with the gene carried in plasmid pMR20-Fur (Figure 1A).
The fur mutant formed smaller colonies than wild-type strain when grown on PYE solid medium for two days at 30 degrees C and the size of the colonies was restored in the complemented mutant strain (data not shown).
To further analyze this apparent slower growth of SP0057, we have evaluated the growth curves of the three strains.
The fur mutant displayed a slower growth rate at exponential phase in PYE medium than the wild-type strain and reached similar cell density at stationary phase.
The complemented strain revealed the same growth characteristics as the wild-type strain, demonstrating that the growth deficiency of the fur mutant was totally complemented (Figure 1B).

The absence of proper control over iron metabolism can cause as a secondary effect a difficulty in coping with oxidative stress, not only because this is generated in the presence of iron via the Fenton reaction, but also because several oxidative stress response enzymes need iron as a cofactor.
The oxidative stress response of SP0057 was analyzed after exposure to the oxidative agents H2O2, paraquat and tert-butyl hydroperoxide.
Increased sensitivity of SP0057 to H2O2 was demonstrated by larger zones of inhibition compared to strain NA1000 in a plate assay (Table 2).
This difference was evident for lawns starting with cells from both exponential and stationary phase cells, and the phenotype was complemented by the fur gene in trans.
The response to superoxide was not affected, as determined by cell viability assay in the presence of paraquat (Figure 2A), but the mutant was extremely sensitive to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (Figure 2B), indicating that it may be impaired in responding to organic hydroperoxides.
These results suggest that the absence of fur in C. crescentus affects more notably the oxidative stress response generated by hydroperoxides than by superoxide.




Weight matrix prediction of C. crescentus candidate Fur-binding sites

As an effort to identify genes directly regulated by Fur, we implemented an iterative approach using different weight matrices to locate potential Fur-binding sites in the C. crescentus genome.
Initially, the C. crescentus genome sequence was scanned using a weight matrix derived from a set of predicted C. crescentus Fur-binding sites detected in an ab initio comparative genomic analysis of multiple alpha-proteobacteria genomes (16).
Of the several potential Fur-binding sites detected in this initial analysis (data not shown), 11 sequences were experimentally validated (Figure 3) and used to obtain a more confident motif model.
The complete list of the predictions obtained by searching the C. crescentus genome with this refined weight matrix is in Supplementary Table S2.
This data set contained almost all predicted sites of the initial search and all experimentally confirmed sites used for matrix construction.
Predicted Fur-binding sites with scores &gt;10 and their associated genes are summarized in Table 3.
To obtain a more realistic estimative of the total of genes regulated by Fur, the genes associated with Fur-binding sites were analyzed with regard to their organization in putative operons (Table 3).


As a rule, we find one predicted Fur-binding site for each gene; however, some present more than one, such as genes CC0001, CC0029, CC0179, CC0228, CC0682, CC1063, CC1362, CC2193, CC2194, CC2367, CC3208 and CC3264 that possess two sites each and gene CC0028 with four putative Fur-binding sites in its promoter region (Table S2).
It is also worth noticing that at least 12 predicted Fur-binding sites were detected in promoter regions of divergent genes (as indicated in Table 3) and this binding might or not affect expression of both genes simultaneously.

Consistent with the definition for a global regulator, Fur-binding sites with high scores are present in genes belonging to diverse functional categories, such as transport and iron uptake systems, energy metabolism (iron-containing enzymes) and transcription regulation among others.
Some of these categories will be discussed below.

Many of the genes associated with Fur-binding sites are involved with iron uptake systems.
Four genes encoding TonB-dependent receptors (CC0028, CC0139, CC2194 and CC2928), as well as others encoding proteins of transport systems belonging to different families showed high scores for predicted Fur-binding sites, suggesting that they may be involved in iron transport (Table 3).
Additionally, low-score Fur-binding sites (scores &gt;5 and &lt;7.5) were also found in front of four more genes encoding TonB-dependent receptors (CC0185, CC1136, CC1666 and CC3161) and of the exbBD-tonB1 (CC2336) and feoAB (CC0711) operons (Table S2).
A possible Fur-binding site is also present in the promoter region of its own gene (CC0057, score 7.26), suggesting that the C. crescentus fur gene is transcriptionally autoregulated, as it has been reported for other bacteria (1).

Predicted Fur-binding sites were identified upstream of several genes and/or operons encoding important iron-containing enzymes that are involved in energy metabolism, such as NADH dehydrogenase (nuo), succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), aconitate hydratase (acnA), cytochrome c oxidase (CC3402) and ATP synthase (CC0367 and CC3450).
Fur-binding sites were also detected upstream of three genes encoding putative ferredoxins: CC3208 (ferredoxin-NADP reductase), CC0068 (ferredoxin, Rieske 2Fe-2S family) and CC3263 (ferredoxin bfd).
Although the bfd gene is adjacent to bfr gene (CC3262, encoding the iron storage bacterioferritin), they are not probably cotranscribed.
In fact, our search did not detect Fur-binding sites in none of the two ferritins (Bfr and Dps) encoded in the C. crescentus genome.



Experimental validation of predicted Fur-binding sites by EMSA and footprinting analysis

To evaluate the functionality of the predicted Fur-binding sites detected by our in silico analysis, 11 regulatory regions of selected genes were PCR-amplified and used in a gel mobility shift assay with the C. crescentus purified Fur protein.
As it can be observed in Figure 3A, all the tested probes were shifted in the presence of up to 500 nM Fur in a dose-dependent manner.
The specificity of Fur binding was demonstrated, since complete loss of the shift was observed when excess unlabeled DNA probe was used as specific competitor (Figure 3A, S lanes) but not with an unlabeled non-specific DNA (Figure 3A, N lanes).
As an additional control, it was demonstrated that the Fur protein did not bind to a DNA probe of similar size corresponding to the fur-coding region even if 1 muM Fur was used.
The assay also allowed a rough estimate of the relative Fur-binding affinity for each fragment, with genes dnaN, nuo and sdh showing the lowest affinities.
Therefore, EMSA experiments confirmed in vitro specific binding of the Fur regulator to all 11 tested DNA fragments containing predicted Fur-binding sites.

As a second validation of the specific binding of Fur, the predicted Fur-binding sites present at the nuo and sdh regulatory regions were mutated, exchanging five of the conserved base pairs for a different sequence.
As shown in Figure 3B, the fragments containing the altered sites were no longer retarded in EMSA, confirming that this conserved region is essential for Fur binding to these fragments.

Most of these validated Fur-binding sites are located in regulatory regions of divergent genes (Table 3).
Admitting its control on each pair of divergent genes, we have confirmed Fur-binding sites controlling expression of at least 19 different genes and/or operons.
Among them are genes known to be regulated by Fur in other organisms such as the ferrous iron transporter feoAB, several TonB-dependent receptors for ferri - siderophore transport (CC0028, CC0139, CC2194 and CC2928), the ferredoxin bfd and a variety of genes encoding iron-using enzymes (acnA, sdhCDAB, nuoA-N and gltDB).

The sdh and CC2194 regulatory regions were further analyzed by DNase I footprinting assay to determine the actual sequence of Fur binding (Figure 4).
Probes consisting of the sdh and CC2194 promoter regions were radiolabelled at one extremity, incubated with increasing amounts of Fur protein and digested with DNase I.
A region corresponding to positions - 102 to - 80 with respect to translational start site of the sdh gene was protected by the Fur protein.
Interestingly, for the CC2194 gene, two regions encompassing positions - 120 to - 87 and - 46 to - 22 with respect to the start codon were protected.
Consistent with these two protected regions, two Fur-binding sites were predicted by the in silico analysis for the CC2194 gene, although only the most upstream one was highly scored.
In conclusion, the nucleotide sequences of these three protected regions correspond to the three predicted Fur-binding sites, confirming a correct prediction of the C. crescentus Fur-binding site by our in silico analysis.




The role of Fur on controlling expression of genes with predicted Fur-binding sites

To determine the effect of Fur in gene expression in vivo, some of the promoter regions of genes with validated Fur-binding sites were cloned in front of a lacZ reporter gene and plasmids containing each transcriptional fusion were introduced into the wild-type NA1000 strain and into the fur mutant strain.
Expression driven by each promoter was assessed by measuring beta-galactosidase activity in the presence of either 100 muM FeSO4 or 100 muM of the iron chelator 2,2-dipyridyl (Figure 5A).
The results showed that the expression driven by the sdhC, acnA and nuoA promoters was diminished in the presence of dipyridyl and in the fur mutant strain, indicating that these genes are activated by Fur in the presence of iron.
The TonB-dependent receptors-encoding genes CC0139, CC0028, CC2928 and CC2194, as well as the feoAB operon, were induced in the presence of dipyridyl in the wild-type strain and constitutively derepressed in the fur mutant strain independently of iron, indicating that Fur represses these genes in response to high iron level.
As a control, expression of CC2194 was also determined in the Fur complemented strain.
The iron-dependent repression of the CC2194 gene was completely restored in this strain.


The results indicated that the sdh, nuo and acnA genes were activated by Fur, showing about 2-fold higher expression in the NA1000 strain than in the SP0057 strain.
In order to determine whether this increase in expression was directly driven by the binding of Fur to the promoter, lacZ expression was determined from transcriptional fusions carrying the nuo and sdh promoter regions with mutated Fur binding sites (Figure 5B).
The results showed that the mutated promoters were unable to generate the levels of expression observed with the original promoters in the wild-type strain.
In fact, those levels were similar to those obtained with the original promoters in the fur mutant strain.
These results confirm that the activation of the nuo and sdh genes in vivo is dependent on Fur binding to the predicted Fur-binding sites.

Transcriptional start sites previously determined (39) were used to analyze the position of some verified Fur-binding sites in relation to the promoter region of the respective genes (Figure 6).
The Fur-binding sites of genes nuoA, sdhC and acnA are found upstream of the deduced - 35 promoter regions, consistent with them being activated by Fur, as verified by gene expression assays (Figure 5).
On the other hand, the Fur-binding sites of genes CC0139, CC0028, CC2928, C2194 and feoA are located overlapping or downstream of the RNA polymerase binding site, suggesting transcriptional repression by steric hindrance.
In fact, all these genes were repressed by Fur in response to high iron level (Figure 5A).
Thus, transcription start sites correlated well with - 35 and - 10 promoter elements and with predicted Fur-binding sites, except for sdhC.
In this gene, the proposed transcriptional start site was found between the - 35 and - 10 elements of an excellent C. crescentus sigma70 consensus (TTGAC-16-CCTANA) and the role of Fur as activator indicates that the Fur-binding site is correctly positioned with regard to this consensus, indicating that the transcriptional start site is probably a few base pairs downstream.


DNA sequence logos were derived from the 11 Fur-binding sites verified in vitro and from all predicted Fur-binding sites with score &gt;7.5, and are represented in Figure 7.
The consensus sequence contains a 19-bp palindromic motif (9-1-9 inverted repeat) that is highly similar to the previously described Furalpha-box predicted for several alpha-proteobacteria (16).
Interestingly, this Fur-binding motif resembles two unknown motifs (motif cc_13 and motif m_3) identified in a global analysis for novel regulatory signals in C. crescentus (39).
The cc_13 motif was identified in a cluster of genes presenting the same cell cycle pattern of expression (39).
In fact, almost all the genes belonging to motif cc_13 were also identified in our search and were shown to be negatively regulated by Fur.
These genes showed an increase in expression in the late predivisional cell (39), which is consistent with the fact that synthesis of Fur was reported to be higher in the stalked cell and decreasing in the predivisional cell (40).
The motif m_3 was found in genes with similar metal response pattern of expression (39), but in this case some genes belonging to that cluster (CC1956, CC3529 and CC3667) were positively regulated by Fur.

The Geobacter sulfurreducens rpoN gene cluster

An rpoN ortholog (GSU1887), which encodes the RpoN sigma factor, is present in the G. sulfurreducens genome.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that G. sulfurreducens RpoN is very similar to other experimentally characterized RpoN sigma factors, such as the Escherichia coli RpoN [19].
The G. sulfurreducens RpoN polypeptide displays characteristic structures of the members of the RpoN family, including an N-terminal glutamine-rich region (the first 50 amino acids), a C-terminal X-link, a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif, and an RpoN box (ARRTVTKYRE) [25].

Analysis of the chromosomal region surrounding the G. sulfurreducens rpoN gene revealed that its downstream genes encode a homolog of a ribosomal subunit interface protein (GSU1886) whose N-terminal domain is homologous to the RpoN modulation protein found in Klebsiella pneumoniae [26] and a homolog of Hpr (Ser) kinase/phosphorylase (GSU1885).
The upstream genes encode an ATP binding protein (GSU1888) and two conserved proteins (GSU1889 and GSU1890) with unknown function (Figure 1a).

In order to understand the physiological role of RpoN and of genes it controls in G. sulfurreducens, construction of a deletion mutant of the rpoN gene was attempted.
However, an rpoN mutant could not be isolated under different growth conditions using media with different electron acceptors (fumarate or Fe(III) citrate) and amendments (glutamine or glutamate) (Table 1).
Different mutagenesis strategies were attempted, including deletion of the whole coding region of the rpoN gene, only the 5'-end of the rpoN coding region, or only the 3'-end of the rpoN coding region (Figure 1b).
No viable mutants were derived from above attempts.
We also constructed an rpoN diploid strain (DLCN43) in which an extra copy of the rpoN gene was integrated into the chromosome and controlled by the promoter from a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (Figure 1c).
Attempts of deleting and replacing the original rpoN gene from DLCN43 also failed.
Furthermore, an extra copy of the rpoN gene under the control of a constitutively active lac promoter, or under the control of an IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside)-inducible taclac promoter was introduced to the wild type strain in trans (Figure 1d).
Attempts of deleting the chromosomal rpoN gene yielded viable isolates.
However, further analysis of these isolates indicated that none of them had deletion of the chromosomal rpoN gene.
In contrast, insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette at the intergenic regions immediately upstream or downstream of the rpoN gene yielded viable mutants, suggesting that the inability to isolate an rpoN-deletion mutant was not due to the polar effects of the kanamycin resistance cassette.
The conditions and mutagenesis methods used in this work for our attempts to isolate a null rpoN mutant are summarized in Table 1, and mutation scheme is illustrated in Figure 1.



RpoN expression patterns and over-expression of RpoN

In order to understand RpoN expression under different growth conditions, Western blot analysis was performed using anti-sera against RpoN with cell extracts prepared from cultures grown with a variety of electron donors/acceptors.
RpoN levels were similar in cultures grown in the presence of ammonium or when nitrogen fixation was required in ammonia-free medium, and RpoN was constitutively expressed under all other conditions tested (Figure 2a).

Because an rpoN deletion mutant could not be obtained, a strain in which the rpoN gene was over-expressed under the control of the IPTG-inducible taclac promoter was generated to gain insights into the function of RpoN.
The strain capable of over-expressing RpoN (DL1/pCDrpoN) and the control strain harboring the empty vector pCD341 (DL1/pCD341) were designated RpoN+ and WTV, respectively, for simplification.
The over-expression of the RpoN protein in RpoN+ after induction was confirmed using Western blot analysis (Figure 2b).
The abundance of the RpoN protein in the RpoN+ strain was 5.4 times more than that of the wild type with IPTG induction, but it stayed at a similar level as that of the wild type in the absence of IPTG.
The WTV strain, with or without the addition of IPTG, had levels of RpoN similar to those in the wild type strain.

When induced with IPTG, the RpoN+ strain grew slower and had a longer lag phase than the WTV strain with either fumarate or Fe(III) citrate as the electron acceptor and acetate as the electron donor (Figure 3a, c &amp;3d).
The effect of over-expressing RpoN on growth was more pronounced when cells were grown in media lacking ammonia (Figure 3b).
The doubling times for the WTV and the RpoN+ strains were 7.5 and 9.7 hours, respectively, in the presence of IPTG in the NBAF medium (Figure 3a).
Under nitrogen fixation conditions, the doubling times for the WTV and the RpoN+ strains were 12.5 and 51.3 hours, respectively, in the presence of IPTG in the ammonium-free NBAF medium (Figure 3b).
For FWAFC media, the doubling times were 9.6 and 14.9 hours with IPTG for WTV and RpoN+, respectively (Figure 3d).
The RpoN+ strain grew similarly with the WTV strain in the absence of IPTG in all media.
These results suggest that over-expression of RpoN inhibited growth under various conditions.



The RpoN regulon identified by genome-scale transcriptome analysis and prediction of RpoN-dependent promoters

To elucidate the function of RpoN in Geobacter species, the transcriptome of the RpoN+ and the WTV strains was compared in order to identify those genes whose transcription is regulated by RpoN.
Due to different growth rates between the two strains in the NBAF medium (Figure 3), total RNA was isolated independently from three sets of WTV and RpoN+ cultures during the exponential growth phase, about OD600 = 0.3 - 0.35 and 0.2 - 0.25 for the WTV and RpoN+ strains, respectively.

With a 1.5 fold-change cutoff and a relatively strong cutoff for false discovery rate (FDR) of p &lt; 0.0005, the RpoN+ strain was found to have 138 genes with increased transcript levels and 59 genes with decreased transcript levels when compared to the WTV strain.
The fold change of the transcription level of the rpoN gene itself was 6.61 higher in the RpoN+ strain than in the WTV strain, which is in agreement with protein over-expression results obtained by the Western blot analysis.
A complete list of the differentially expressed genes and their expression ratio is provided as additional files (see Additional files 1 &amp;2).
The 196 genes with significant changes in expression level in the RpoN+ strain were assigned to 16 functional groups.
Most of them encoded hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown function (63 genes).
The top three categories of genes with annotated functions consisted of genes associated with protein synthesis (33), energy metabolism (21 genes), and transport and binding (12).

In addition to observing the RpoN regulon by using gene expression microarrays, we employed computational analysis using the PromScan software [27] to identify RpoN recognition sequence elements within the G. sulfurreducens genome.
The search identified 798 putative RpoN recognition sequence elements with scores GTEQ 80 (data not shown).
Among these sequence elements, 467 elements were located upstream of protein-coding genes, in the same strand orientation as their potential target genes.
Of these possible promoter elements that could potentially regulate transcription of protein-coding genes, 110 were located in noncoding regions.
We considered these 110 sequence elements to be the most likely RpoN-regulated promoters.
Their sequences and genome locations are provided in Additional file 3, while their predicted target genes and operons are provided in Additional file 4.
The consensus sequence of these 110 predicted G. sulfurreducens RpoN-regulated promoter elements listed in Additional file 3 was TTGGCACGGTTTTTGCT, where the -24 GG and the -12 GC dinucleotides are in bold.
The highest scoring RpoN-regulated promoter was located upstream of the flagella biosynthesis operon containing the fliA gene encoding the RNA polymerase sigma factor FliA (sigma28) (see Additional file 4).

Genome locations of the 110 RpoN-dependent sequence elements identified using the PromScan analysis were cross-examined with the list of genes identified by the transcriptome analysis with a fold change cutoff of 1.25.
The results of this comparison are listed in Additional file 5, and selected operons encoding genes related to nitrogen assimilation, appendages and solute transport are listed in Table 2.
These combined data showed that RpoN regulatory elements can be found in not only up-regulated genes, but also down-regulated genes.
The increased transcript levels observed for some genes could result from increased RpoN availability for transcription initiation that is the limiting factor at a normal rpoN transcript level.
The decreased transcript levels for some genes could be due to the fact that RpoN alone can bind to the -24/-12 elements without the core RNAP, and therefore the promoter regions may not be accessible by other sigma factors, or less core RNAP may be available in the excess of RpoN [1,28].

Both microarray transcriptome analysis and computational prediction of RpoN promoter elements concluded that the dcuB gene, which encodes the fumarate/succinate exchanger (C4-dicarboxylate transporter), is RpoN-dependent.
Both analyses also indicated that genes encoding components for nitrogen assimilation, such as glutamine synthetase (GS) (GSU1835), are RpoN-dependent (Table 2).
Furthermore, our computational analysis identified an RpoN promoter upstream of the glutamate synthetase (GSU1239, GOGAT) operon.
The microarray analysis indicated that the gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (GSU1305) is RpoN-dependent.

In silico modeling analysis was utilized to understand the role of GDH, GS and GOGAT enzymes in G. sulfurreducens metabolism.
The growth of G. sulfurreducens was simulated under different growth conditions, varying electron donors, electron acceptors, and nitrogen sources.
In silico modeling analysis suggested that missing both GS and GOGAT enzymes or GDH, GS and GOGAT is lethal under all growth conditions.

Other genes identified by both the transcriptome analysis and the computational promoter prediction include those encoding flagella biosynthesis, formate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Table 2 and Additional file 5).

An RpoN-dependent regulatory element, located upstream of the pilA gene encoding pilin, the building block for nanowires [29], was identified by the PromScan software in this study and by 5'-RACE analysis in an earlier study [30].
Therefore, the effect of RpoN-overexpression was tested on the pili formation via a cell agglutination assay at 25 degrees C [31].
In the presence of IPTG, the RpoN+ strain displayed less agglutination at 25 degrees C than WTV and WT (Figure 3e), which strongly suggests that RpoN is involved in pili biogenesis.

Genes that were differentially expressed in the RpoN+ strain but for which no RpoN-dependent regulatory elements could be found include those encoding components of stress response/molecular chaperones, central metabolism, extracellular electron transfer, and genes encoding regulatory proteins (see Additional files 1 &amp;2), suggesting their possible indirect regulation by RpoN or a possibility that their RpoN promoters may be too divergent from promoters in other bacteria to be detected using computational approaches.
Alternatively, the physiological states caused by the overexpression of RpoN in the RpoN+ strain, which were different from those in the WTV strain, such as slower growth, might affect gene regulation.



Evaluation of predicted RpoN-dependent promoters via primer extension analysis

In order to further validate the results of the microarray transcriptome analysis and of the computational promoter prediction and to examine promoters regulating differentially expressed genes, primer extension assays were carried out on 12 selected operons or singleton genes, including seven genes with increased expression and five genes with decreased expression in the microarray analysis (Table 3).
These selections included 1) genes involved in cellular functions that were reported in other bacteria to be RpoN-dependent, such as flagella biosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation; or 2) genes involved in physiological functions that were not previously reported to be RpoN-dependent in other bacteria, but were predicted to have conserved RpoN-dependent -24/-12 promoter elements in their regulatory regions, or 3) genes encoding enzymes that are essential for cell growth.
The trend of changes in transcript levels observed in the primer extension assays was similar to that reported in the microarray analysis (Figure 4, Table 3 and Additional file 6), with an exception of GSU1836 (glnB), which encodes a PII nitrogen regulatory protein.

Eight genes out of the 12 selected genes had promoter elements identified by the primer extension assays to match those identified by the computational predictions, and six of these eight genes were found to be regulated by promoter sequences highly similar to other bacterial RpoN promoter elements (Table 3).
These six RpoN-regulated genes were GSU0420 (fliL), GSU1836 (glnB), GSU2806 (nifEN), GSU3046 (flgJ), GSU2751 (dcuB) and GSU0777 (fdnG) (Figure 4 &amp;5 and Table 3).
Alignment of these six G. sulfurreducens RpoN promoter elements and of the promoter element upstream of the pilA gene identified in the previous study [30] was shown (Figure 5).

While conserved RpoN-regulated promoters were predicted for other four genes/operons (GSU0939, GSU2005, GSU2490 and GSU3206) by the computational tools (see Additional file 4), no -24/-12 RpoN-dependent promoter elements could be identified by primer extension assays for these genes/operons (see Additional file 6).
It is possible that the predicted RpoN-regulated promoter elements for these four genes/operons are activated only under certain conditions, such as nitrogen-fixing conditions, which were different from the conditions for the primer extension assays.

In conclusion, the primer extension analyses showed that RpoN-regulated promoters are located upstream of genes for a fumarate/succinate exchanger (GSU2751, dcuB), glutamine synthetase (GSU1836-1835 operon, glnB-glnA), flagella biosynthesis proteins (GSU0420 - 0426, and GSU3040 - 3046), nitrogen assimilation enzymes (GSU2802 - 2806), and a formate dehydrogenase (GSU0777 - 0781).
In addition, an RpoN-regulated promoter was also identified for the pilA gene (GSU1496) by 5'-RACE analysis [30].

Expression and function of the citrate synthase

In order to better understand the regulation of the expression of gltA, the gene encoding citrate synthase, the abundance of gltA transcripts and the citrate synthase protein was compared under a diversity of growth conditions.
Western blot analysis revealed that the abundance of the citrate synthase protein was lowest when hydrogen was the electron donor and fumarate was the electron acceptor (Figure 1A).
Of the other conditions evaluated, growth with lactate as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor yielded somewhat higher levels of the citrate synthase protein.
Primer extension assays showed that the abundance of gltA transcripts followed a similar pattern (Figure 1B), suggesting that the expression of gltA was primarily regulated at the level of transcription.

The putative -35/-10 promoter elements assigned on the basis of the 5' end of the mRNA sequence in the primer extension assays (Figure 1C) show similarity to those of E. coli RpoD-dependent promoters (34,35) and to those of G. sulfurreducens RpoD/RpoS-like promoters (36).
The promoter region contains the putative extended -10 element (37,38).
Putative transcription termination signals were found downstream of the translation termination codon (Figure 1D).
These results suggest that gltA is monocistronic.

A gltA deletion mutant was isolated with hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor with acetate as the carbon source.
Lactate could be substituted for acetate as the carbon source (Table 1).
The mutant was unable to grow with organic acids such as acetate and lactate as the electron donor.
This is expected because gltA encodes the only citrate synthase in G. sulfurreducens (24), and citrate synthase is required for the entry of acetyl-CoA derived from organic acids into the TCA cycle (39).
The mutant also failed to grow with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor even in the presence of hydrogen.
Therefore, the citrate synthase was required for all growth conditions other than with hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor, consistent with the low expression of gltA under this growth condition.


Citrate synthase also plays critical roles in growth on organic acids in other microorganisms.
For instance, the absence of the citrate synthase influences the growth rate on propionate, as a citrate synthase-negative strain of E. coli grows significantly more slowly than its parent strain (40).
This citrate synthase mutant can still grow on propionate because E. coli possesses 2-methylcitrate synthase, which is induced during growth on propionate (40).
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which contains two citrate synthase isozymes, mitochondrial and cytosolic, a deletion of the mitochondrial citrate synthase causes failure in growth on acetate, while the absence of the cytosolic citrate synthase does not affect growth on acetate (41).



Transcriptional regulation of gltA expression

The possibility that the expression of gltA is transcriptionally regulated was further investigated.
A DNA-binding assay performed with the gltA promoter region as a probe detected DNA-binding activity in cell extracts prepared from cultures grown with fumarate as the electron acceptor and acetate or hydrogen as the electron donor (Figure 2A), the growth conditions under which the transcript abundance of gltA was low (Figure 1B).
In contrast, the DNA-binding activity was undetectable or extremely low, under the other growth conditions in which the transcript abundance of gltA was higher.
These results suggested that a transcriptional repressor was involved in the gene regulation.

To determine the binding site for the putative transcriptional repressor, a footprint assay was performed (Figure 2B).
The region from nt +11 to +23 with respect to the transcription initiation site was protected from DNase I in the presence of the ammonium sulfate fraction prepared from cell extracts (see also Figure 1C for the sequence).
This repressor-binding site shows the dyad symmetry.

To examine the effects of this region on the promoter activity, a lacZ fusion assay was carried out (Figure 2C).
When the promoter region up to nt -195 with respect to the transcription initiation site was included, there was high beta-galactosidase activity.
However, no activity was observed when only the region up to nt -2 was included.
Deleting the binding site from the promoter fused to the lacZ gene doubled beta-galactosidase activity over that of the wild-type promoter.
These results further indicate that a transcription factor repressed the expression of gltA by binding the promoter region from nt +11 to +23.



Other genes involved in metabolism

Searching the genome of G. sulfurreducens for the transcriptional repressor binding site sequence of gltA (Figure 1C) revealed that this sequence is also located upstream of the genes encoding aconitase B (acnB), isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd), 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase ferredoxin subunit (oorD), succinyl:acetyl CoA transferase (ato), succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase cytochrome b subunit (frdC), ATP synthase F0 beta' subunit (atpG), nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerase (nad), NADH dehydrogenase I A subunit (nuoA), soluble Fe(III) reductase beta' subunit (sfrB), sugar phosphate isomerase/epimerase (iolE) and a transcription factor (gntR) in the GntR family (Figure 3A).
These putative binding sites also show the dyad symmetry.
These genes, except for the transcription factor, appear to encode proteins involved in biosynthesis and energy generation, such as the TCA cycle and electron transport systems.
It appears that some of these identified genes (acnB, icd, oorD, frdC, atpG, sfrB, nad and nuoA) are the first gene in an operon and others (ato, fumA, iolE and gntR) are monocistronic.
For example, the frdC gene is co-transcribed with frdA and frdB, the genes encoding the other two subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase complex (42).
An analysis of the genome sequence suggested that the icd gene for isocitrate dehydrogenase is in an operon with the mdh gene encoding malate dehydrogenase.
The oorD gene encoding a subunit of 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase appears to be in an operon with the genes oorA, oorB and oorC which encode three other subunits of 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase.
It is likely that the atpG gene is the first gene of the operon encoding other subunits of ATP synthase F0F1.
The nuoA gene appears to be the first gene of the operon encoding other subunits of NADH dehydrogenase I.
It appears likely that the sfrB gene composes an operon with the sfrA gene (43).


All of the genes evaluated (atpG, nuoA, sfrB, frdC, icd and gntR) had lower transcript abundance during growth with hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor (Figure 3B), similar to the results with gltA (Figure 1B).
The genes involved in the TCA cycle, frdC and icd, as well as sfrB and gntR had expression patterns similar to gltA under other growth conditions (Figure 3B).
However, atpG and nuoA had transcript abundances during growth on acetate with fumarate as the electron acceptor that were as high as or higher than during growth on lactate.
This contrasts with the higher transcript abundance during growth on lactate for the other genes.

Primer extension assays indicated that the putative repressor binding sites are located at the downstream region of the transcription initiation site, the region overlapping the transcription initiation site, or the region overlapping the -35/-10 promoter elements (data not shown).
These results suggest that the transcriptional repressor inhibits RNA polymerase from binding to the -35/-10 promoter elements or from elongating transcripts.

Searching the genomes of other Geobacter species demonstrated that the transcriptional repressor binding site sequence in the gltA promoter region identified in G. sulfurreducens is conserved within the genus (see Figure 4 for the gltA genes, data not shown for others).
These results suggest that this transcriptional repressor is a regulator for the genes involved in biosynthesis and energy generation in Geobacter species.




Identification of the transcriptional repressor

In order to identify the transcriptional repressor, putative transcription factors encoded in the G. sulfurreducens genome were analyzed.
Among 151 putative transcription factors from G. sulfurreducens, 81 are highly conserved in both G. metallireducens and G. uraniireducens, the other Geobacter species for which other complete genome sequences were available at the time of analysis.
Putative transcription factors that appeared to be involved in regulatory functions, such as a heat-shock responsive repressor, SOS responsive factors and RNA-binding proteins, were excluded from the subsequent assays.
Homologues of enhancer-binding proteins were also excluded because they are typically involved in activation of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase containing the alternative sigma factor RpoN (44 - 46) whereas the genes regulated by the transcriptional repressor are likely transcribed by RNA polymerase containing the major sigma factor RpoD, as described above.
This left 30 putative transcription factors which were selected for the further study.

Of the 30 putative transcription factors evaluated, GSU3370, GSU3298 and GSU3364 bound the gltA promoter region (Figure 5A).
However, GSU3370 showed a different binding pattern from that observed with the G. sulfurreducens cell extracts (Figure 2A), while GSU3298 did not bind the promoters of atp, nuo and gntR (data not shown).
Thus, it is unlikely that GSU3370 or GSU3298 was the repressor.
The ability of GSU3364 to bind the promoter regions of atpG, nuoA and gntR, three other genes predicted to have a repressor-binding site (Figure 3A), was evaluated and GSU3364 bound all the three promoters (Figure 5B).
Footprint assays demonstrated that GSU3364 bound specifically the promoter regions of gltA, atpG, nuoA and gntR (Figure 5C) in the same region expected from the studies outlined above for gltA (Figure 2B) and atpG, nuoA and gntR (Figure 3A).
Therefore, GSU3364, which was termed hydrogen-dependent growth transcriptional repressor (HgtR), is likely the transcriptional repressor.
Although GSU3298 and GSU3370 are not the repressor that binds the sequence identified by the footprint assay (Figure 2B), it is possible that these transcription factors are involved in the regulation of gltA under different growth conditions.
Sequence analysis suggests that putative DNA-binding domains of GSU3298 and GSU3370 are similar to those of the XRE and GntR family, respectively, while their putative regulatory (sensor) domains do not exhibit high similarity to known domains (data not shown).
Their roles in the regulation of gltA remain to be examined.


HgtR is a relatively small protein consisting of 62 amino acid residues (Figure 5D).
As expected, HgtR is conserved in all Geobacter species whose genome sequences are available (Figure 5D).
Although the homologues of HgtR in some of other Geobacter species were annotated as CopG-like DNA-binding protein, the amino acid sequences of HgtR homologues showed no similarity to known proteins.



Expression and function of HgtR

Primer extension assays demonstrated that the expression of hgtR was higher when hydrogen served as the electron donor than in acetate-grown cells (Figure 6A).
This is consistent with the previous results that the genes on which the transcriptional repressor acts were expressed at lower levels during growth on hydrogen.


The highly conserved sequences, GG and GC, of the -24/-12 promoter elements recognized by RpoN (44 - 46) were identified (Figure 6B).
A transcription termination-like signal was found at the downstream of the translation termination codon (Figure 6C), suggesting that hgtR is monocistronic.

When the gene for HgtR was deleted, the mutant was unable to grow with hydrogen as the electron donor and either fumarate or Fe(III) as the electron acceptor (Table 2).
Transcript levels of gltA and nuoA were examined during growth with either acetate or hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor.
Their transcript levels were much higher in the hgtR mutant than the wild-type during growth both in the absence and presence of hydrogen (Figure 7A).
It should be noted that the hgtR mutant grew with acetate as the electron donor as well as the carbon source even in the presence of hydrogen whereas the wild-type cells grew with hydrogen as the electron donor and acetate as the carbon source in the presence of hydrogen.
This suggests that HgtR represses the expression of gltA and nuoA during growth with acetate as the electron donor as well as during growth with hydrogen as the electron donor, which is consistent with the results showing that the activity of HgtR was detected in the culture under these conditions (Figure 2A).
Moreover, this aberrant gene expression caused by the deletion of hgtR made the hgtR mutant cells unable to adapt to growth with hydrogen.


To further evaluate the function of HgtR, a plasmid containing hgtR was introduced into G. sulfurreducens and HgtR was overexpressed.
The overexpression of HgtR resulted in repression of gltA expression (Figure 7B).
This is consistent with the conclusion that HgtR is the repressor for gltA.

Cyclic AMP Binding at Two Independent Sites Enhances CRPMt-DNA Interactions

Whereas E. coli CRP is very responsive to cAMP, exhibiting nonspecific low affinity DNA binding in the absence of cAMP (27), previous reports of the effects of cAMP on the properties of CRPMt have been equivocal.
Rickman et al. (16) and Bai et al. (15) found significant binding of CRPMt to target DNA in the absence of cAMP and only marginal enhancement upon addition of up to 0.1 mm cAMP.
In contrast, Agarwal et al. (17) failed to detect DNA binding in the absence of cAMP, but binding was observed in the presence of 1 mm cAMP.
Others have shown that incubation with cAMP alters intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (41) and the polypeptide profiles obtained when CRPMt is digested with trypsin (15), implying that cAMP causes conformational changes in CRPMt.
To investigate further, we have isolated recombinant His6-tagged CRPMt by overproduction in a cyaA mutant of E. coli, which is unable to synthesize cAMP.
This cAMP-free CRPMt protein was then used to determine the polypeptide profiles obtained after digestion of CRPMt with trypsin in the absence and presence of cAMP (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 - 7).
In contrast to E. coli CRP, which is relatively resistant to trypsin cleavage in the absence of cAMP (42), CRPMt was readily digested by trypsin, yielding a major polypeptide of molecular mass ~16 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A).
In the presence of cAMP, the protein was more resistant to proteolysis, and a major polypeptide of molecular mass ~15 kDa was obtained.
In the presence of cGMP, the sensitivity of CRPMt to trypsin was similar to that observed in the absence of cAMP, although a different digestion pattern, which included both major polypeptides (~16 and ~15 kDa) observed in the absence and presence of cAMP, was obtained suggesting that cGMP is bound by CRPMt with concomitant changes in conformation that are different from those invoked by cAMP (Fig. 1A, lanes 10 - 15).
Significantly, addition of cAMP after preincubation with cGMP for 10 min, or vice versa, resulted in a limited proteolysis pattern identical to that obtained with cAMP alone indicating that cAMP is the preferred ligand (Fig. 1A, lanes 20 - 24).
To ensure that the presence of the His6 tag was not influencing the interaction of CRPMt with cAMP, the His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, and the partial proteolysis experiments were repeated.
This showed that untagged CRPMt exhibited the same behavior as the tagged protein in the absence (supplemental Fig. S1, lanes 3 and 6) and presence (supplemental Fig. S1, lanes 4 and 7) of cAMP suggesting that the His6 tag was not affecting the gross conformational changes induced by cAMP binding.
Therefore, the His6-tagged form of CRPMt was considered suitable for further ligand binding studies.

Isothermal calorimetry was used to determine the stoichiometry and affinity of cAMP binding to His6-CRPMt.
A typical titration is shown in Fig. 1B.
The data yield good nonlinear least squares fitting to a single set of identical binding sites model and are consistent with each protomer of the CRPMt dimer binding one cAMP molecule with relatively weak (Kb of ~1.7 x 104m-1) affinity.
Furthermore, the binding of cAMP is an endothermic reaction (DeltaGb -23.7 kJ mol-1) with a positive binding enthalpy (DeltaHb ~ 30.7 kJ mol-1).
Therefore, the entropy change TDeltaSb is ~54.4 kJ mol-1 K-1, and hence cAMP binding is entropically driven.
Chemical cross-linking showed that CRPMt is a dimer (not shown), and thus the data indicate that unlike the E. coli CRP dimer, the two cAMP-binding sites in the CRPMt dimer are independent.

The effect of cAMP binding on the ability of CRPMt to bind DNA in vivo was tested in the heterologous host E. coli because M. tuberculosis has 17 predicted adenylyl cyclase proteins, and E. coli has only one, CyaA; and thus it is possible to simply create a cAMP-free background for these experiments.
The parent E. coli strain was a crp lac double mutant into which a cyaA mutation was introduced.
The readout (beta-galactosidase activity) from the simple CRP-repressed promoter CCgalDelta4, which contains a consensus CRP site that is recognized by CRPMt located such that occupation of this site occludes the promoter (18, 34), was used as a measure of the DNA binding activity of CRPMt as shown previously by Spreadbury et al. (18).
In the CyaA+ and CyaA- strains containing the vector (ptac85), transcription from the reporter was similar (761 +- 24 and 722 +- 25 Miller units, respectively, n = 5).
However, in the presence of the CRPMt expression plasmid (pGS1645), reporter transcription was ~60% lower (323 +- 86 Miller units, n = 5) in the Cya+ strain compared with that observed in the absence of CRPMt, consistent with the observations of Spreadbury et al. (18).
However, in the cyaA mutant, which is unable to synthesize cAMP, the readout from the reporter in the presence of CRPMt increased by ~2-fold (613 +- 20 Miller units, n = 5) compared with the Cya+ strain to reach ~80% of the activity observed in the absence of CRPMt.
These data are consistent with cAMP enhancing DNA binding of CRPMt in vivo.

To investigate the effect of cAMP on CRPMt DNA binding in vitro, preliminary electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to show that CRPMt formed at least two complexes at the whiB1 promoter in the absence and presence of cAMP but that DNA binding was enhanced in the presence of cAMP (supplemental Fig. S2A).
Furthermore, in cAMP titration experiments, CRPMt binding to the whiB1 promoter was enhanced when the cAMP concentration exceeded 0.05 mm (not shown), consistent with the isothermal calorimetry experiments.
Moreover, the presence of the His6 tag did not significantly affect DNA binding by CRPMt in the absence (not shown) and presence of cAMP (supplemental Fig. S2B).
Thus, the His6-tagged form was used in further DNA binding studies.

In summary, the work described above shows the following: (i) that CRPMt binds two cAMP molecules per dimer (one per subunit); (ii) that the cAMP-binding sites act independently; and (iii) that cAMP binding induces conformational changes in the CRPMt dimer that enhance specific DNA binding in vitro and in vivo.



whiB1 Promoter Contains Two CRPMt-binding Sites

The whiB1 gene encodes a Wbl (WhiB-like) protein.
These proteins have iron-sulfur clusters and are found only in actinomycetes (26) where they are thought to function as transcription factors and/or as protein-disulfide reductases.
The whiB1 transcript was less abundant in a CRPMt mutant (16), implying that CRPMt activates whiB1 expression, which was confirmed using a whiB1-lacZ fusion (17).
5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to confirm that the whiB1 transcript start was located at 109 or 110 bp upstream of the translational start as reported by Agarwal et al. (17) (data not shown).
The electrophoretic mobility shift assays (supplemental Fig. S2A) suggested the presence of more than one CRPMt-binding site in the whiB1 promoter.
Inspection of the whiB1 promoter region indicated the presence of two potential CRPMt-binding sites upstream of the transcript start (Fig. 2).
The first site (CRP1) located at -58.5 relative to the transcript start matches the proposed CRPMt consensus (NGTGNNANNNNNCACA) of Rickman et al. (16) in seven of the eight defined bases (Fig. 2).
The second potential site (CRP2) is a poorer match to the consensus (six of the eight defined bases are matched) and is located at -37.5 relative to the transcript start.
The CRP1 site has previously been implicated in CRPMt-dependent activation of whiB1 expression (17).

DNase I footprinting showed that both CRP1 and CRP2 sites in the whiB1 promoter were recognized by CRPMt and that binding to both sites was enhanced in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 3A).
Titration of the whiB1 promoter with increasing concentrations of CRPMt showed that the CRP1 site (-70 to -51) was occupied before the CRP2 site (-50 to -29) (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, mutation of CRP1 (indicated by lowercase letters, AGTGAGATAGCCCACG to AGTtAGATAGCCaACG) or CRP2 (CGTAACACTATTGACA to CcaAACACTATTGACA) inhibited binding of CRPMt to these sites (Fig. 3B).
Inactivation of CRP1 also impaired, but did not abolish, binding to CRP2 (Fig. 3B, compare lane 5 with 6).
Thus, it was concluded: (i) the whiB1 promoter possesses tandem CRPMt sites, (ii) binding to these sites is enhanced in the presence of cAMP; and (iii) occupation of CRP2 is improved by occupation of CRP1.



Both CRPMt-binding Sites in the whiB1 Promoter Are Functional

The DNase I footprinting studies indicated that there are two CRPMt sites in the whiB1 promoter.
The functionality of the sites was tested by in vitro transcription experiments.
Transcription from the whiB1 promoter in the presence of M. smegmatis RNAP was low (Fig. 4A, lane 3).
At low concentrations of CRPMt, whiB1 transcription was enhanced, but at higher concentrations CRPMt inhibited transcription (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 - 8).
This same pattern of regulation was observed with the untagged form of CRPMt (supplemental Fig. S3, compare lanes 3 - 6 and lanes 7 - 10), indicating that the presence of the His6 tag does not alter the transcriptional behavior of CRPMt.
A similar transcription profile was observed in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 - 16) except for the following: (i) there was a reproducible decrease in basal transcription (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 11), and (ii) the response curve was shifted to the left, with maximum whiB1 expression occurring in the presence of 1.3 mum CRPMt in the presence of cAMP compared with 2.5 mum CRPMt in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 4B).
This result is consistent with cAMP enhancing CRPMt binding to both CRP1 and CRP2 sites in the whiB1 promoter.
In conjunction with the footprinting experiments described above, these data were interpreted to mean that binding to the high affinity CRP1 site activates whiB1 transcription, whereas occupation of both CRP1 and CRP2 sites inhibits whiB1 transcription.
This conclusion was supported by in vitro transcription reactions with whiB1 promoters carrying mutations in CRP1 and/or CRP2 (Fig. 4C).
At a low CRPMt concentration (2.5 mum) in the absence of cAMP, the footprinting evidence indicates that CRP1 will be occupied at the wild-type promoter.
Under these conditions, mutation of the CRP1 site decreased transcription of whiB1 (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 1 and 2).
Under the same conditions, mutation of CRP2 slightly enhanced whiB1 transcription (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 1 and 3).
A similar pattern was observed in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 5 - 7).
At a higher CRPMt concentration (20 mum), the footprints indicate that both CRP1 and CRP2 will be occupied.
Under these conditions, impairment of CRP1 had little effect on transcription compared with the wild-type promoter, i.e. transcription remained low (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 9 and 10 and lanes 13 and 14).
However, impairment of CRP2 enhanced transcription of whiB1 compared with the wild-type promoter under these conditions (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 9 and 11, and lanes 13 and 15).
Hence, these observations suggest that occupation of CRP2 is sufficient to repress basal transcription from PwhiB1.
In the presence of cAMP, mutation of both CRPMt sites resulted in transcription similar to that of the unaltered promoter in the absence of CRPMt (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 8 and 16).
In the absence of cAMP, transcription from the whiB1 promoter with both CRP1 and CRP2 impaired was lower than from the unaltered promoter in the absence of CRPMt, suggesting that in the absence of cAMP there is still some unproductive interaction between CRPMt and the altered whiB1 promoter despite the impairment of both CRP-binding sites (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 4 and 12).
Note that transcription in the absence of CRPMt for all the altered promoters was the same as that for the unaltered whiB1 promoter, indicating that the changes to the sequences of the CRP sites had not affected the basal level of transcription (data not shown).

The in vitro transcription experiments showed that CRPMt acts as both an activator (at low concentrations) and repressor (at high concentrations) of whiB1 expression.
Permanganate footprinting to detect open complex formation showed the presence of quantitatively similar distortions of DNA at nucleotide T -8 in the whiB1 promoter mediated by RNAP in the presence or absence of 2.5 mum CRPMt (Fig. 5A, lanes 3, 4, 8, and 9).
This evidence suggests that CRPMt-mediated activation of whiB1 expression probably occurs after open complex formation, because in the absence of CRPMt transcription from the whiB1 promoter is low (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4).
In the presence of 20 mum CRPMt, the open complex was not detected (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 10) indicating that higher concentrations of CRPMt inhibit whiB1 expression at a point before open complex formation, probably by inhibiting RNAP binding.

DNase I footprinting of the whiB1 promoter in the presence of M. smegmatis RNAP and activating concentrations of CRPMt (2.5 mum) showed that RNAP could bind at the promoter when the CRP1 site was occupied and that this was accompanied by the appearance of an RNAP-dependent hypersensitive site at position -34, which is within the CRP2 site (Fig. 5B).
The presence of the hypersensitive site is attributed to docking of the C-terminal domain of the RNAP alpha-subunit downstream of CRPMt bound at CRP1.

To determine whether the effects of CRPMt on whiB1 transcription observed in vitro were also apparent in vivo, a promoter fusion containing DNA from -187 to 129 relative to the transcript start was fused upstream of a lac reporter gene, and transcription was estimated in M. tuberculosis wild-type H37Rv and an isogenic Rv3676 (crp) mutant (Fig. 6).
Under exponential growth conditions, expression of whiB1 was decreased by ~3-fold in the CRPMt mutant (DeltaRv3676), consistent with CRPMt-dependent activation.
An ~5-fold reduction in expression was observed when the CRP1 site was disabled, reflecting the absence of activation from CRP1 but retention of repression from CRP2.
Accordingly, mutation of CRP2, without disrupting the -35 element (underlined) of the whiB1 promoter (CGTAACACTATTGACA to CcaAACACTATTGACA), resulted in a small but reproducible increase in whiB1 expression.
Similarly, improvement of the CRP2 site (CGTAACACTATTGACA to CGTgACACTATTGACA) caused a reproducible decrease in whiB1 expression.
Disabling both CRP1 and CRP2 lowered beta-galactosidase activities by an amount similar to that observed using the unaltered promoter in the crp mutant.
The in vivo data correlated well with the in vitro transcription data as shown in Fig. 4, C and D. Thus, when 2.5 mum CRPMt was used in the in vitro transcription reactions (Fig. 4D), the fold changes in transcription upon impairment of CRP-binding sites compared with the unaltered promoter were as follows: -3.5 to -2.4 when CRP1 was impaired; +1.2 to +1.6 when CRP2 was impaired; and -2.6 to -2.0 when both CRP1 and CRP2 were impaired.
These values are similar to those obtained for transcription in vivo (Fig. 6) as follows: -4.6 when CRP1 was impaired; +1.2 when CRP2 was impaired; and -2.0 when CRP1 and CRP2 were impaired.
Hence, the in vitro and in vivo experiments are consistent with a mechanism in which occupation of CRP1 enhances whiB1 expression, whereas occupation of both CRP1 and CRP2 or of CRP2 alone represses whiB1 expression in M. tuberculosis.

pioABC expression is induced during anaerobic growth

To assess differences in the expression of the pioABC operon in R. palustris TIE-1, our first approach was to use quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).
Comparison of the mRNA abundance of pioA, pioB and pioC under various growth conditions revealed that expression was lowest during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth.
This condition was therefore used as a baseline to calculate the relative fold change in mRNA abundance.
Expression of the pioABC transcripts was highly upregulated during photoferrotrophic growth relative to aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth (Fig. 1A).
Interestingly, pioABC mRNA transcripts were in general higher during anaerobic phototrophic growth, although transcript levels were significantly higher under photoferrotrophic conditions.

To complement our qRT-PCR transcriptional data, we constructed an integrative lacZ reporter to determine the in vivo expression of the pioABC operon under various conditions.
The pioABC genes form an operon as shown previously (Jiao and Newman, 2007).
With the assumption that a single promoter drives the expression of the pioABC operon, we fused the entire intergenic region between pioA and the upstream gene Rpal_0818, in frame with the ATG start codon of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli that encodes beta-galactosidase.
This led to formation of a lacZ translational fusion that was subsequently integrated onto the chromosome of WT R. palustris TIE-1.
The level of beta-galactosidase activity measured from this strain represented a combination of transcription and translation initiation.
Assessment of beta-galactosidase activity under various growth conditions revealed that there was no detectable activity of the pioABC operon during aerobic growth.
beta-Galactosidase activity was observed under all anaerobic growth conditions tested, being highest during photoferrotrophic growth (Fig. 1B).
beta-Galactosidase activity was 10-fold higher during photoferrotrophic growth compared with photoheterotrophic growth on succinate.
Overall, these data are qualitatively similar to what we observed with qRT-PCR.



The pioABC transcription start site is a guanine residue upstream of which lie two canonical FixK binding sites

The transcription start site (TSS) of the pioABC operon was determined during photoheterotrophic growth on succinate, photoautotrophic growth on H2 as well as photoferrotrophic growth on Fe(II).
cRACE and 5' RLM-RACE revealed that the TSS of the pioABC operon is a guanine residue 177 bp upstream of the predicted ATG start codon of pioA under all the growth conditions tested (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2).
5' RLM-RACE also revealed the presence of a processed site, which is an adenine residue 152 bp upstream of the predicted start codon.
This processed site might be important for regulation mediated either by regulatory proteins or other mechanisms.
A similar site has been observed in the E. coli yfiD promoter under the control of the Fnr protein (Green et al., 1998).
Assessment of the region near the TSS revealed the presence of -10 and -35 core promoter elements of which only the -10 resembles the E. colisigmaf70 consensus (McClure, 1985).
Centred at -44.5 is a canonical FixK box (named FixK I) assigning this promoter to a CRP/FNR class II promoter (Mesa et al., 2005).
Another canonical FixK box (FixK II) is centred at position -137.5.
Use of two identical binding sites has been observed for interaction of Fnr with the yfiD promoter and CRP interaction with the acsP2 promoter in E. coli (Green and Baldwin, 1997; Beatty et al., 2003).



Both identified FixK binding sites influence expression of the pioABC operon in vivo

To assess the importance of the canonical FixK binding sites conserved in the pioABC promoter, we constructed DNA templates lacking either FixK I or FixK II boxes and fused them in frame with lacZ, forming translational fusions.
These constructs were then integrated onto the chromosome of WT R. palustris TIE-1 and assayed for beta-galactosidase activity on various growth substrates.
Deletion of FixK I led to dramatic downregulation of beta-galactosidase activity on all the substrates tested (Fig. 3).
These data demonstrated that FixK I was important for activation of expression of the pioABC operon.
Only a modest downregulation of beta-galactosidase activity was observed when FixK II was deleted.
This suggests that although the primary DNA site that influences pioABC expression is FixK I, FixK II does play a role in activating pioABC expression.



deltafixK has a phototrophic iron oxidation defect and is severely impaired during anaerobic phototrophic growth

The identification of FixK binding sites in the pioABC promoter and the influence of these sites on pioABC expression implicated the FixK protein in controlling expression of this operon.
We thus deleted this gene (Rpal_4729) from the chromosome of the PpioA - lacZ translational fusion strain and confirmed the mutant using PCR (Fig. S3).
This deltafixK strain was then characterized with respect to phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation and defects in growth (Fig.4 and Table S1).
Comparison of the ability of deltafixK and WT R. palustris TIE-1 to oxidize Fe(II) phototrophically revealed that deltafixK was severely delayed in photoferrotrophic growth (Fig. 4).
WT R. palustris TIE-1 started oxidizing Fe(II)-NTA at ~ 120 h after inoculation while deltafixK showed first signs of Fe(II)-NTA oxidation at ~ 320 h post inoculation.
Eventually, both WT and deltafixK were able to oxidize 5 mM Fe(II) with 10 mM NTA to completion as well as achieve similar levels of total protein content.
The rate of Fe(II)-NTA oxidation by WT and deltafixK also appeared to be similar [~ 0.03 mM Fe(II)-NTA oxidized per hour].
No significant difference in lag time was observed between WT and deltafixK during aerobic growth on YP medium, although slight differences in generation time were detected (Table S1).
In contrast, a substantial increase in lag time was observed in deltafixK versus WT during anaerobic phototrophic growth in FW medium.
In general, the deltafixK mutant had lower pigmentation both during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth as well as phototrophic growth (Fig. S4).
A similar defect was observed in R. palustris CGA009 and was attributed to production of lower amounts of reaction centre as well as light harvesting complexes 1 and 2 (LH1 and 2) (Rey and Harwood, 2010).
Moreover, the expression of genes for the LH1 complex (pufAB) was found to decrease slightly in the deltafixK mutant (Rey and Harwood, 2010).
Reasoning that the lower pigmentation in the R. palustris TIE-1 deltafixK mutant was likely due to similar expression changes, we next sought to determine whether the phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation defect was an indirect effect or due to a direct interaction between the pioABC promoter with FixK.



FixK affects expression of the pioABC operon

To assess whether FixK directly affects pioABC expression, we determined expression of this operon in deltafixK versus WT using qRT-PCR and translational reporter gene fusions (Fig. 5).
No significant difference was observed between pioABC transcripts levels in the deltafixK mutant versus WT during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth on succinate (Fig. 5A).
However, expression of the pioABC genes increased in the deltafixK mutant versus WT under all the phototrophic conditions tested except during photoferrotrophic growth, when pioABC mRNA decreased in the mutant.
The translational fusion data coincided with the mRNA abundance data and showed that beta-galactosidase activity increased in the deltafixK mutant versus WT under most phototrophic conditions tested but decreased during photoferrotrophic growth.
The decrease in beta-galactosidase activity during photoferrotrophic growth was approximately fivefold.
The stability of the beta-galactosidase enzyme might account for the modest decrease in expression from the Ppio - lacZ fusion compared with the dramatic decrease in pioABC mRNA abundance.
Overall, these data suggest that FixK either directly or indirectly regulates expression of the pioABC operon in response to growth conditions.
The only condition we identified under which FixK activated pioABC expression was photoferrotrophy, whereas repression occurred on all other phototrophic conditions tested.
Complementation of the deltafixK mutant with either WT or N-terminal His6-tagged FixK resulted in partial restoration of pioABC expression as well as full restoration of FixK expression during photoferrotrophic growth (Fig. S4).
The complemented strains had similar pigmentation to WT during phototrophic growth most likely due to restored production of haem, bacteriochlorophyll and LH1 and LH2 complex proteins similar to that observed in R. palustris CGA009 (Fig. S4) (Rey and Harwood, 2010).
Why only partial restoration of pioABC expression occurred is unclear.



FixK directly binds the FixK I box of the pioABC promoter

To determine whether FixK could directly interact with the identified FixK I and FixK II boxes, we performed gel mobility-shift assays using recombinant FixK protein (Fig. S5 and Fig. 6).
These experiments showed that purified FixK protein was able to bind a double-stranded (ds) DNA substrate that had the FixK I box as well as a dsDNA substrate that had both the FixK I and FixK II box.
However, purified FixK did not bind a dsDNA substrate that had only the FixK II box.
FixK binding was specific as it could be competed out with competitive unlabelled DNA.
In addition, purified FixK was unable to bind a non-cognate, Oct2A (a eukaryotic transcription factor; Corcoran and Shore, 2000) binding site containing dsDNA substrate (provided in the DIG Gel Shift Kit, Second Generation; Roche, Indianapolis, IN).
Overall, these data suggest that FixK binds the pioABC promoter at the FixK I box but not the FixK II box, thereby mediating regulation of this operon.
Although the FixK II box was observed to be important for expression in vivo, it did not bind FixK.
This implies that either it binds other proteins in the CRP/FNR family or can bind FixK only under specific conditions absent in our in vitro assay.
DNA topology of the FixK II box and/or the low binding affinity of FixK protein for this site might also account for this result.



Putative FixK target genes are upregulated during anaerobic phototrophic growth

The R. palustris CGA009 genome was scanned for the presence of potential FixK binding sites in a previous study (Conlan et al., 2005).
Canonical FixK boxes were observed in the promoter regions of 21 ORFs in this organism including pioA.
We therefore identified homologues of these genes in R. palustris TIE-1 and assessed the change in their expression using qRT-PCR.
The fold change in mRNA abundance was calculated with respect to aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth on succinate (Table 1).
This revealed that a number of selected genes are upregulated more than fivefold during phototrophic growth.
These genes encompassed a number of different aspects of the physiology of R. palustris TIE-1 including respiration, photosynthesis, gene regulation and transport.
A detailed description of these genes can be found in the supporting information.
Their upregulation during anaerobic growth suggests that they are likely part of the FixK regulon in R. palustris TIE-1 that allows it to adapt to anoxia as shown recently for R. palustris CGA009 under microoxic conditions (Rey and Harwood, 2010).



FixK affects the expression of a number of predicted target genes

To establish the influence of FixK on expression of the putative target genes, we determined their level of expression in WT R. palustris TIE-1 using qRT-PCR and compared it with deltafixK (Table 2).
Only one gene, encoding a putative potassium uptake protein (kup1), showed more than fivefold increase in expression in deltafixK under anaerobic growth conditions (Schleyer and Bakker, 1993).
Transcripts for this gene were not significantly upregulated during any anaerobic growth condition in the WT (Table 1).
In contrast, expression of 14 of the 20 putative FixK target genes assessed decreased in deltafixK.
hemO, ccoN(OQP) and bchD, all photosynthetic genes, showed a dramatic decrease in deltafixK during phototrophic growth.
The regulatory genes selected were also downregulated more than fivefold on at least one anaerobic growth condition in deltafixK.
Some other interesting genes encoding transport-related functions also emerged as FixK targets such as Rpal_4015 (predicted ORF involved in siderophore biosynthesis), Rpal_4994 (ompW homologue), Rpal_1868 (osmY homologue), Rpal_2582 (first gene of a heavy metal transporting operon) and Rpal_1412 (a signal peptide containing ORF with transmembrane domains).
Two ORFs Rpal_1413 (putative inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase) (Zhang et al., 1999) and Rpal_1691 (hypothetical protein) were also modestly downregulated in deltafixK.

Screening of genes conferring E. coli resistance to ColE7

To search for genes that can confer E. coli resistance to ColE7, plasmids in the genomic library were transformed into the ColE7-sensitive E. coli strain DH5alpha, and the transformants were plated on LB agar plates containing 50 mug/ml of ampicillin and 5.0 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7.
Two colonies were seen after incubation at 37 degrees C overnight.
The plasmids of each colony were isolated after culturing in 3 ml LB medium containing 50 mug/ml of ampicillin then retransformed into DH5alpha.
The new transformants were plated on agar plates containing 0, 1.3, 2.6, 3.9, or 5.2 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 to confirm their resistance to ColE7.
The insert in the plasmid that conferred DH5alpha resistance to 5.2 ng/ml His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 was sequenced.
A 1,470-bp DNA region on the chromosome at position 3662617 to 3664086 was analyzed that contains both complete gadX and gadY genes.
The plasmid was thus named pGadXY (Figure 1).

To determine whether gadX or gadY was responsible for ColE7 resistance, pGadX, pGadY, and pGadXY that contain gadX, gadY, and gadXY, respectively, were separately introduced into E. coli strain DH5alpha and then assayed for their ability to confer ColE7 resistance.
1 x 105 cells containing pGadX, pGadY, or pGadXY were plated on LB agar containing 1.3, 2.6, 3.9, or 5.2 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7.
Cells containing the vector pGAD10 were also plated to serve as controls.
The percent survival of cells containing pGAD10, pGadXY, pGadX, and pGadY in the presence of 1.3 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 were 41.7, 95.5, 71.4, and 73.5%, respectively, and 1.5, 63.9, 3.6, and 9.1%, respectively, in the presence of 2.6 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7.
Only pGadXY conferred ColE7 resistance to 3.9 and 5.2 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 with 29.1 and 17.1% survival rates, respectively (Table 1).



Detection of protein whose expression is affected by gadXY

To investigate the mechanism by which gadXY affects ColE7 resistance, the expression levels of BtuB, TolQ, TolR, TolA, TolB, Pal, and OmpF that are involved in ColE7 import were determined by Western blotting, and BtuB was the only protein found to be affected.
Its expression level was reduced by 93% in the presence of gadXY (Figure 2) as determined by densitometry.



Effect of gadXY on btuB promoter

To determine whether gadXY affects the transcription of btuB, the beta-galactosidase reporter assay was performed.
The 461-, 673-, 913-, and 1285-bp DNA fragments (Figure 3) containing the promoter of btuB were fused with the lacZ coding sequence to generate pCB461lacZ, pCB673lacZ, pCB913lacZ, and pCB1285lacZ, respectively.
Each of these single copy plasmid together with pGAD10 or pGadXY was transformed into E. coli strain DH5alpha.
The transformed cells were grown in LB medium with 50 mug/ml of chloramphenicol and ampicilin to OD600~0.8 then assayed for beta-galactosidase activity as described by Miller [39].
The beta-galactosidase activity of cells containing pGadXY and a pCB derivative with the btuB promoter-lacZ fusion was divided by that of cells containing the control plasmid pGAD10 and the same pCB derivative to determine the percent decrease in btuB promoter activity in the presence of gadXY.
The btuB promoter in the 461-, 673-, 913-, and 1285-bp DNA fragment was found to be decreased by 45.7, 47.1, 54.5, and 56.7%, respectively in the presence of gadXY, and was about 6 fold more active in the 1285-bp fragment than in other fragments (Table 2).

To investigate the effect of gadX or gadY alone on the promoter activity of btuB, the same experiment was performed using DH5alpha cells containing pCB1285lacZ and pGAD10, pGadXY, pGadX, or pGadY.
The beta-galactosidase activity of cells containing pCB1285lacZ and pGadXY, pGadX, or pGadY was compared to those containing pGAD10 and pCB1285lacZ.
The results indicated that btuB promoter activity was decreased 20.5% by gadX and 20.3% by gadY, but was decreased 54.4% by gadXY (Table 3).



Binding of GadX to btuB promoter

GadX has been shown to be a DNA binding protein and can bind to the gadA or the gadB promoter.
To determine whether GadX also binds to the btuB promoter, the DNA mobility shift assay was performed.
Only GadX was assayed because gadY does not encode any proteins.
The 461-bp DNA fragment containing the btuB promoter was labeled with 32P and incubated with 2, 4, or 6 pmoles of purified GadX protein (MalE-GadX) that was fused to the maltose binding protein.
The DNA fragment containing the promoter of gadA or gadB was used as the positive control for GadX binding, and the DNA fragment containing the pal promoter was used as the negative control.
As shown in Figure 4, DNA band shift was observed on gadA and gadB promoter fragments but not on the negative control.
Band shift was also observed on the btuB promoter fragment in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GadX binds to the btuB promoter.



Identification of binding sequence of GadX on btuB promoter

DNase I footprinting was then performed to determine the binding sequence of GadX on the btuB promoter.
The 461-bp DNA fragment containing the btuB promoter was labeled with 32P and incubated with 0, 2, 4, or 8 pmoles of purified MalE-GadX protein and then digested with DNase I.
Results shown in Figure 5 revealed three MalE-GadX protein binding sites that included nucleotide positions +56 - +81 (I), +96 - +105 (II) and +123 - +137 (III) on the 5' untranslated region of btuB.



Decreased btuB expression under acidic conditions

It is known that gadX and gadY are more highly expressed under acidic environments in stationary phase [15-19,28].
To determine whether the expression of btuB is also repressed in an acidic condition, wild type BW25113 cells were cultured in LB medium pH 7.4 or buffered with 100 mM MES pH5.5.
Stationary phase cells grown in different culture media were collected and then assayed for the transcriptional level of btuB by quantitative real-time PCR.
The cDNA amplification comparison results showed the transcription of gadX with 1.4-fold increase but the level of btuB was reduced to 57% (Table 4).

OxyS is a conserved mycobacterial LysR-type regulator and is involved in regulation of katG

Using a previously developed bacterial one-hybrid system, we have successfully isolated a number of novel transcription factors involved in the regulation of virulence genes in M. tuberculosis[19].
Interestingly, among the many newly identified transcription factors, we found OxyS was involved in the regulation of katG.
The M. tuberculosis OxyS protein shares strong sequence identity with the LysR-type transcriptional regulator family (conserved domains database (CDD), NCBI).
As shown in Fig. 1A and 1B, the N-terminal part of OxyS contains the helix-turn-helix motif and the C-terminal region contains a LysR substrate-binding domain which is structurally homologous to type-2 periplasmic binding proteins.
Furthermore, the N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif of OxyS was found to be highly conserved among several different mycobacterial species (Fig. S1, Table 1).

A previous study implied that OxyS is involved in regulation of KatG activity in M. tuberculosis[17].
Since the regions upstream of the katG gene in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis are highly conserved [8] (Fig. S2) we decided to explore that further by over-expressing M. tuberculosis OxyS in M. smegmatis to determine the physiological role of OxyS.
As shown in Fig. 1C, OxyS reached a high level of expression in the recombinant strain as revealed by Western blotting assays using anti-OxyS serum.
Notably, qRT-PCR (Quantitative real-time PCR) analysis indicated that the level of katG expression in the recombinant M. smegmatis strain was only 36% of that of the control strain (Fig. 1D).
In contrast, the expression level of furA showed no significant change when compared with M. smegmatis strains harboring empty vectors.
These results indicate that the expression of katG is negatively regulated by OxyS, while the furA expression is not regulated by OxyS.



OxyS directly targets the promoter region of katG in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis

To examine whether a direct interaction occurs between OxyS and the regulatory sequence of the M. tuberculosis katG gene, a bacterial one-hybrid assay was conducted by cloning the katG promoter region upstream of HIS3-aadA reporter genes of the bacterial one-hybrid reporter vector pBXcmT (Fig. 2A) [19].
As shown in Fig. 2B, co-transformant strains with the katG promoter and OxyS grew well on selective plates.
In contrast, the strains containing either OxyS alone or the katG promoter alone did not grow on selective plates.
In addition, co-transformant strains containing the promoter of Rv3911 (Rv3911p), an unrelated promoter, and OxyS did not grow either (Fig. 2B).
These results indicate that OxyS can specifically interact with the promoter of the katG gene.

Using anti-OxyS antibodies and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays, we characterized the association of OxyS with the katG promoter in vivo in M. tuberculosis.
Fig. 2C (top panel) shows that the signal for katG promoter was enriched in the anti-OxyS immunoprecipitate compared with that in the control sample without any antibody.
In contrast, no obvious signal was observed for the promoter of Rv3911 (Rv3911p) in both the anti-OxyS and the control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, bottom panel).
We successfully purified soluble His-tagged OxyS from an E. coli expression system by inducing the expression of MtbOxyS protein under low temperature conditions (Fig. S3).
Binding of the purified OxyS protein with the katG promoter was then confirmed by further EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) experiments.
As shown in Fig. 2D, when increasing amounts of OxyS (100 - 600 nM) were added into the reactions, shifted bands corresponding to the OxyS/katG promoter complex were observed and a corresponding increase in the percentage of protein/DNA complexes was seen.
Using competitive EMSA assays (Fig. S4C), we comfirmed that this interaction was specific.
Notably, the interaction of OxyS with the promoter of MsmkatG was also confirmed in the recombinant OxyS-overexpressing M. smegmatis strain by both ChIP and EMSA assays (Fig. S5).

Taken together, these results indicate that OxyS can specifically interact with the promoter of the katG gene in vivo and in vitro, and this direct interaction is conserved in both M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis.



Characterization of the binding sites and sequence motifs for OxyS in the promoter region of katG

To identify the binding sites for OxyS in the promoter region of katG (katGp), we first obtained two short DNA fragments (katGp1 and katGp2) of the katG promoter (Fig. S4A).
As shown in Fig. S4B, OxyS could form specific protein/DNA complexes with the substrates katGp and katGp2.
In contrast, no binding activity was observed for the substrate katGp1.
In addition, unlabeled katGp and katGp2 could competitively inhibit the binding of OxyS with the labeled DNA substrate, while unlabeled katGp1 had no effect on OxyS binding (Fig. S4C).
This indicates that the -1 to -180 region (katGp2) of the katG promoter contains the binding site for OxyS.

Two fragments - foot1 and foot2 - were further designed (Fig. S4A) to precisely determine the binding sites for OxyS in the katG promoter by DNase I footprinting assays.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the foot1 and foot2 fragments were incubated with increasing amounts of the OxyS protein and digested with DNase I.
Several regions were protected from digestion in the presence of the OxyS protein (Fig. 3A).
Two OxyS binding boxes, named OxyS box1 and OxyS box2, were further found in the protected regions, as indicated in Fig. 3B.
The core OxyS binding sites of M. tuberculosis katG also contained the LysR-binding motif T-N11-A, which has previously been shown to be a classic LTTR box [18].

A blast assay for the binding sequence for OxyS (OxyS box1) among different mycobacterial species revealed a conserved, GC-rich T-N11-A motif (G[C]TGC[T]CTGA[G]CNC[G]C [G]C[G]T[G]CGGACG[C]AC[T]A[G]A[G]) (Fig. 3C).
Specific binding of OxyS to the motif was then confirmed by base replacement and EMSA assays.
As shown in Fig. 3D, when the conserved "TG" and "GA" in OxyS box1 were replaced by "CC", the OxyS protein lost its ability to bind to the mutant DNA substrate as evidenced by the result of our EMSA assay that specific protein/DNA complexes were observed for the wild type substrate (Fig. 3D, left panel), but no such complex was observed for the mutant substrate (Fig. 3D, right panel).



The DNA-binding ability of OxyS is inhibited by H2O2 and Cys25 is a regulatory residue

We assayed the effect of redox reagents on the DNA-binding ability of OxyS.
As shown in Fig. 4A, a stepwise decrease in amounts of the specific protein/DNA complex was observed as 0.01 - 3 mM H2O2 was added to the DNA-binding reaction mixture (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 - 5).
In contrast, no effect was observed when DTT (dithiothreitol) was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 - 10), indicating that the ability of OxyS to bind DNA was specifically reduced by H2O2.
We also examined the expression level of katG in the M. smegmatis strain under oxidative stress (due to OxyS over-expression) by qRT-PCR assays.
As shown in Fig. 4B, the expression level of katG increased 2-fold after 2 mM H2O2 treatment, indicating that the negative regulation of katG by OxyS was eliminated.

The OxyS protein contains four cysteines (Fig. 1B), and two of them (Cys25 and Cys113) were found to be conserved among several mycobacterial OxyS orthologs (Fig. S1).
Cysteine residues have been shown to be responsible for redox-sensing in many transcriptional regulators [20] - [22].
To identify the sites responsible for sensing oxidative stress in OxyS, site-directed mutations were introduced into these cysteine residues in the oxyS gene.
The mutant proteins were expressed and successfully purified from an E. coli expression system (Fig. S3).
As shown in Fig. 4C, all the mutant proteins maintained their DNA-binding ability when compared with wild-type protein.
We examined the effect of these mutations on the ability of OxyS to bind to DNA in response to H2O2.
Cys113, Cys124 and Cys293 mutations did not change the sensitivity of OxyS to H2O2 (Fig. 4D).
Interestingly, the DNA-binding activity of the mutant protein OxyS-Cys25A, in which the mutation was situated in the DNA-binding domain of OxyS, was not affected by H2O2 (Fig. 4D) indicating that it lacked the ability to respond to the oxidative signal.
These results indicate that the Cys25 residue is involved in the regulation of the DNA-binding ability of OxyS under oxidative stress, while the other three cysteine residues are dispensable.

The fate of OxyS and its mutant variants after peroxide treatment was further determined by native-PAGE assays.
As shown in Fig. S6, addition of 3 mM H2O2 (lane 3) changed the electrophoretic mobility of OxyS and all its mutant variants.
In contrast, addition of 3 mM DTT (lane 2) neither altered the electrophoretic pattern nor changed the electrophoretic mobility of MSMEG_6092, a DNA binding protein from M. smegmatis with no cysteine residues (Fig. S6).
These results indicate that purified OxyS proteins are in a reduced state and are capable of redox-sensing.

Taken together, our results lend support to a model in which all the cysteine residues in OxyS can sense oxidative signal, but Cys25 is the only regulatory cysteine residue capable of both sensing the oxidative signal and regulating the ability of OxyS to bind to DNA under oxidative stress.



OxyS-Cys25A lacks the ability to respond to the oxidative signal in vivo in M. smegmatis

We first examined the effect of over-expressing OxyS on oxidative stress response in M. smegmatis using a modified bacterial growth time course assay.
As shown in Fig. 5A, we observed that the M. smegmatis strains over-expressing OxyS were more sensitive to H2O2 as 2 - 5 mM H2O2 was added to the medium if compared with the control strain.
This is consistent with a previous observation [17].
The findings of our detailed bacterial growth time course assays with increasing concentrations of H2O2 also support the same conclusion (Fig. S7).
As shown above, overexpression of OxyS lowered expression of the katG gene in M. smegmatis (Fig. 1D) and OxyS-Cys25 is a regulatory cysteine residue (Fig. 4D).
Thus, we further compared the DNA-binding ability of mutant OxyS proteins with that of the wild type protein for the promoter of katG in vivo in response to H2O2.
As shown in Fig. 5B, when over-expression of OxyS-WT or OxyS-C113A in M. smegmatis, the signal for katG promoter with 2 mM H2O2 treatment was reduced substantially in the anti-OxyS immunoprecipitate if compared with that in the control sample without H2O2 treatment.
In contrast, no obvious signal change for the enriched katG promoter in response to H2O2 was observed for over-expression of OxyS-C25A (Fig. 5B).
Therefore, the mutant protein OxyS-Cys25A lacked the ability to respond to the oxidative signal in vivo in M. smegmatis.

The Expression of the H2-T6SS Genes Is Controlled by Quorum Sensing

Although the H1-T6SS cluster is repressed by RetS/Gac signaling system in PAO1, the H2-T6SS and H3-T6SS are not (3, 24 - 26).
To probe the transcriptional regulation of the H2-T6SS gene cluster, we analyzed the DNA region upstream of the first gene, hsiA2 (PA1656), of the cluster in PAO1 (Fig. 1A).
Two sigma70-dependent promoters were predicted in the intergenic region between the upstream gene (PA1655) and hsiA2 (PA1656) by the BProm program (Fig. 1B).
We created a lacZ transcriptional fusion in which the DNA region upstream of the ATG of the first gene of the H2-T6SS cluster was fused to lacZ and integrated at the CTX phage attB site as a single copy on the chromosome, yielding strain PAO1TS2.
Strain PAO1Z was similarly constructed by integrating a promoter-less lacZ gene to serve as a negative control (Table 1).
The beta-galactosidase activity profile associated with the transcriptional fusion indicated that the H2-T6SS gene cluster expression was low during the exponential phase but increased at 3 h of growth in TSB medium at 37 degrees C, during the log to stationary phase transition (Fig. 2A).
The expression was at its highest (10-fold above background) in stationary phase, whereas promoter activity was undetectable in the control strain PAO1Z.

The biphasic, cell density-dependent expression profile of the reporter fusion suggested that the transcription of H2-T6SS might be regulated by QS.
This could be in agreement with the regulation by LasR of the PA14 hcp2 gene, which lacks in PAO1 (19).
We therefore examined H2-T6SS expression in P. aeruginosa QS mutants.
Two homoserine lactone-mediated QS systems, the Las and Rhl systems, have been described in P. aeruginosa (27).
The transcriptional regulators LasR and RhlR are activated by their cognate autoinducers, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone and N-(butanoyl)-l-HSL (C4-HSL) produced by the LasI and RhlI synthases, respectively.
The pTS2 fusion was integrated on the chromosome of a lasR mutant (PAOR) (28) and that of a rhlI mutant (PDO100) (29) creating PAORTS2 and PDO100TS2 QS mutant strains.
Compared with wild type PAO1, the expression of H2-T6SS was significantly delayed in the two QS mutants, becoming detectable 6 h post-inoculation, with maximal levels decreased 22- and 8.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B).
Complementation in trans of the lasR mutation in PAORTS2 with pBLasR, a plasmid constitutively producing LasR, affected the growth of the strain (the strain stops growing at A600 = 2.5) but restored the fusion activity almost to its wild type levels at the exponential phase (filled circles in Fig. 2B).
N-Acylhomoserine lactone synthase mutants, such as rhlI, can be phenotypically complemented by addition of the corresponding N-acylhomoserine lactone (30, 31).
The addition of the C4-HSL (10 mum) to the rhlI mutant PDO100TS2 restored induction of the expression at the transition phase of growth, and the expression was 4-fold higher than in the mutant (Fig. 2B).
One can note that the decrease in H2-T6SS expression observed with the lasR mutant is greater (2.6-fold) than with the rhlI mutant.
This may imply a direct effect of LasR, as well as an indirect effect mediated through Rhl system.

Thus to confirm a direct effect of RhlR-C4-HSL on H2-T6SS expression too, the H2-T6SS promoter region was cloned into pMP220 to generate a plasmid borne lacZ transcriptional fusion whose expression was quantified in a strain of E. coli, which harbored IPTG-inducible copies of rhlR and rhlI.
Upon RhlR and RhlI production, a 3.3-fold up-regulation of the H2-T6SS promoter region was observed (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the Rhl system is sufficient for the induction of H2-T6SS expression.

The promoter region of QS regulated genes in P. aeruginosa usually contains a Las-Rhl box, a 20-bp repeat located approximately between 60 and 40 bp from the start of transcription (32, 33).
As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), a putative Las-Rhl box can be identified in the upstream region of the H2-T6SS gene cluster, but far from the two predicted promoters.
Using 5' rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends PCR, we located a transcription initiation site 246 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon of the hsiA2 gene (the +1 position is indicated in gray in Fig. 1B).
We were thus able to position -10 and -35 boxes of a sigma70 promoter in proximity of the Las-Rhl box centered at -47 with respect to the transcript start site.
Together, our studies support the notion that the expression of the P. aeruginosa H2-T6SS genes appears to be directly controlled by the Las and Rhl QS systems.



H2-T6SS Gene Expression Is Induced in Iron-limiting Conditions and Regulated by Fur

For many pathogens, the host environment is often iron poor, which triggers the expression of a group of genes transcriptionally regulated by iron through the ferric uptake regulator protein Fur.
In addition to its role in iron homeostasis, Fur is involved in the coordinate regulation of numerous virulence genes.
In the case of P. aeruginosa, Fur regulates exotoxin A and alkaline protease production (34, 35), as well as biofilm formation (36).
We noted the presence of a sequence upstream of the H2-T6SS gene cluster that conformed to the E. coli and P. aeruginosa consensus Fur binding sequence (GATAATGATAATCATTATC) (37, 38) or the (NATWAT)3 sequence proposed as the E. coli Fur box (39) (Fig. 1, B and D).
The two putative Fur boxes overlapped with the -10 box of the two predicted sigma70 promoters, suggesting that Fur binding at this position in presence of iron prevents RNA polymerase binding to the -10 box and thus represses transcription.
To test this, PAO1TS2, which harbored the H2-T6SS-lacZ transcriptional fusion, was grown in TSB in presence of the iron chelator 2,2'-bipyridyl (250 mum).
The activity of the promoter was induced 2.2-fold in these conditions (Fig. 2D).

To determine whether Fur is required for H2-T6SS regulation and because Fur seems to be essential for P. aeruginosa viability (40), the expression of the plasmid borne transcriptional fusion was studied in an E. coli WT and isogenic fur mutant.
After 4 h of growth, the activity of the fusion increased by 2.6-fold in the Fur mutant (Fig. 2E).
Together, these data suggest that transcription of the H2-T6SS gene cluster is induced under iron-limiting conditions, an environment that the pathogen encounters in the human host.



H2-T6SS Contributes to P. aeruginosa Internalization in Non-phagocytic Cells

Although P. aeruginosa is considered an extracellular pathogen, it is able to measurably enter (i.e., invade) normally nonphagocytic cells ((41), for a review see Ref.77).
To address the potential role of H2-T6SS in P. aeruginosa internalization, we constructed a nonpolar mutant in the AAA+ ATPase ClpV2 whose homologue was shown to play a crucial role in the functionality of the H1-T6SS system (3, 42).
We verified that the mutation does not affect the growth of the strain, nor the major adhesins of P. aeruginosa (flagellum and type IV pili), nor the secretion of ExoS, an anti-internalization factor (supplemental Fig. S1).
Moreover, adhesion of the clpV2 mutant was unaffected (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B).
We then compared invasion of transition phase grown wild type PAO1 with a mutant defective in H2-T6SS (PAO1DeltaclpV2), using a standard antibiotic protection assay adapted from Ref.
43.
As shown in Fig. 3A, PAO1 was able to invade nonphagocytic cells, with an average of 1.7% of adherent bacteria internalized (supplemental Fig. S2C), whereas PAO1DeltaclpV2 entry into host cells was reduced by ~75%.
Invasion was restored to wild type levels in the complemented clpV2 mutant (Fig. 3A).

Because we previously observed a cell density expression pattern of H2-T6SS genes, we asked whether the growth phase of the bacteria impacts the internalization capacity.
Although exponential grown clpV2 mutant bacteria were less internalized (~75% reduction as with transition phase bacteria; data not shown), stationary phase bacteria were internalized at the same level as the wild type strain (supplemental Fig. S3).

Even if P. aeruginosa escapes the normal bactericidal mechanisms of epithelial cells, it only poorly replicates in A549 pneumocytes (41) or in corneal epithelial cells (43).
Given the length of the infection in the invasion assay (5 h including the gentamicin treatment), to examine the possibility of an intracellular replication and/or persistence defect of the clpV2 mutant, we compared the number of intracellular bacteria after 2.5 and 5.5 h of infection for each strain.
After allowing 3 h for bacterial replication, we observed the same range of data (between 4.9- and 6-fold increase) for all the strains (Fig. 3B).
In conclusion, the H2-T6SS mutant displays an invasion defect.

In a complementary assay, HeLa cells were infected with GFP-labeled P. aeruginosa and visualized by laser confocal microscopy (data not shown).
Few bacteria were found in HeLa cells infected with the wild type PAO1.
Conversely no bacteria were found in cells infected with the clpV2 mutant.
Together, these results support the assertion that the H2-T6SS system stimulates internalization of P. aeruginosa into HeLa cells.



Akt Phosphorylation upon Bacterial Invasion of Polarized Epithelial Cells Is Dependent on H2-T6SS

We further explored H2-T6SS-dependent bacterial entry into a more physiologically relevant cell line, Calu-3 cells, which are derived from human lung alveolar cells and which form polarized monolayers when grown on Transwell filters.
P. aeruginosa binding to polarized epithelial cells activates a central host signaling molecule, PI3K, which is required for phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis and for activation of a downstream effector, the protein kinase B/Akt (Akt) (44, 45).
Activation of the PI3K/phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/Akt pathway was shown to be necessary and sufficient for P. aeruginosa entry from the apical surface (44).
This event leads to a remarkable remodeling of the apical membrane in which protrusions enriched for phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and actin form at the apical surface at the site of bacterial entry (46).
To determine whether the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is required during the H2-T6SS-dependent uptake of P. aeruginosa by lung epithelial cells, polarized human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells were infected in the presence or absence of LY294002 (LY), a PI3K inhibitor, and adhesion, internalization, and Akt phosphorylation were determined.
Although the treatment with LY did not affect bacterial adhesion, it reduced invasion of both PAO1 and the complemented PAO1DeltaclpV2 mutant in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A).
Internalization levels of the clpV2 mutant were lower than that of PAO1 or the complemented clpV2 mutant; thus, LY treatment had little effect on the ability of the clpV2 mutant to enter host cells (Fig. 4A).

We next determined whether Akt is activated in an H2-T6SS dependent manner, as determined by phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473.
Polarized Calu-3 cells were co-cultivated with PAO1, clpV2 mutant, or the complemented clpV2 mutant.
At 60 min after infection, Akt was immunoprecipitated followed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-AktSer473 antibody.
The ratio of phospho-Akt to total Akt was quantified and normalized to the ratio observed in untreated cells.
Infection with the clpV2 mutant resulted in ~50% decrease in Akt phosphorylation levels compared with infection with PAO1 or with the complemented mutant (Fig. 4, B and C).
The magnitude of the decrease in Akt phosphorylation was similar to the magnitude of the decrease in internalization by the clpV2 mutant (Fig. 4, B and C).
LY treatment decreased Akt phosphorylation upon infection with any strain to levels observed in uninfected Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4, B and C).
Together, these data suggest that H2-T6SS stimulates bacterial entry of transition phase-grown bacteria through the PI3K/Akt pathway.



H2-T6SS Contributes to P. aeruginosa Virulence in C. elegans

The involvement of H2-T6SS in P. aeruginosa pathogenicity led us to test its role in virulence on C. elegans.
Previous studies have shown that C. elegans is a good model in which to identify P. aeruginosa virulence genes important for mammalian pathogenesis (47, 48).
In a modified slow killing assay, we observed that the clpV2 mutant was significantly less virulent than the PAO1 strain (Fig. 5), indicating that H2-T6SS plays a role in P. aeruginosa virulence.

Identification of promoter regions

We used lacZ as a reporter gene, to measure the activity of M. tuberculosis promoters thought to be regulated by PhoP in M. smegmatis, a non-pathogenic and fast-growing mycobacterial species.

Several fragments corresponding to upstream and structural gene regions of pks2 (-86,+60), msl3 (-282,+28) and fadD21 (-198, +10) were generated (Table 1).
These fragments were inserted upstream from the lacZ reporter gene in the pJEM15 E. coli-mycobacterial reporter shuttle plasmid.
For lipF, a 611 bp region (-596, +14) was used, because this region has previously been reported to be required for the upregulation of transcriptional activity in response to exposure to an acid stress.
This upregulation has been demonstrated in both pathogenic M. tuberculosis and non-pathogenic M. smegmatis strains [27].
Cultures of M. smegmatis transformed with the empty pJEM15 vector, a positive control, the pJEM31 (PAN) vector containing a promoter sequence, PAN, isolated from M. paratuberculosis[28] or recombinant pJEM15 plasmids carrying lipF, pks2, msl3 or fadD21 gene fragments were set up.
Aliquots of cultures were collected during the exponential growth phase and beta-galactosidase activities were assessed to determine transcription levels.

As indicated in Fig. 1, expression levels were higher for M. smegmatis transformed with the recombinant plasmids carrying pks2, msl3, lipF or fadD21 gene fusions than for M. smegmatis transformed with the empty pJEM15 vector.
No significant expression was detected for M. smegmatis transformed with the empty pJEM15 vector.
With the plasmid pJEM31 (PAN) used as a positive control, we observed expression of similar magnitude as observed for pks2, msl3 and fadD21.
A much lower expression was observed for M. smegmatis carrying the lipF fusion, under the conditions tested.
These results demonstrate that there was a promoter present in the various cloned regions in fusion with lacZ gene.



Identification of PhoP binding sites

We investigated whether PhoP bound directly to the DNA sequences upstream from lipF, pks2, msl3 and fadD21 identified in gene fusion studies, by carrying out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with phosphorylated PhoP protein (PhoP-P).
In fact, previous studies have shown that PhoP must be phosphorylated for efficient binding to specific sites.
We also carried out EMSA with the regulatory binding region of the PhoP gene itself, Protect40, as a positive control [29], [30].
Only positive bindings were shown in Fig. 2.
We started by using PCR fragments of about 200 bp in size for EMSA (Table 1, Table 2, and Fig. 2A).
For the lipF promoter region, we generated three 200 bp subfragments: lipFa (-596 to -375), lipFb (-394 to -168) and lipFc (-167 to +14).
Only lipFa displayed a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of PhoP-P (Fig. 2A and Fig.S1).
For msl3, we generated two subfragments: msl3a (-282 to -49), which was about 200 bp in length, and msl3b (-67 to +28), which was about 100 bp long.
Only msl3a displayed a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of PhoP-P (Fig. 2A).

The 147 bp (-86 to +60) pks2 and the 209 bp (-198 to +10) fadD21 fragments used in beta-galactosidase experiments also displayed a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of PhoP-P (Fig. 2A).
To address relative affinity differences between the DNA substrates, we varied the protein to DNA ratio to obtain a complete shift.
The protein concentrations used ranged from 0 to 8 microM, for a constant DNA concentration of 40 nM.
All five regulatory regions studied (lipF, pks2, msl3, fadD21 and phoP) bound to PhoP-P resulted in the detection of higher molecular weight bands.
For msl3a, fadD21 and pks2, a PhoP-P:DNA ratio of 100:1 was sufficient to obtain an almost complete shift, whereas a ratio of 200:1 was required for lipFa.
The various DNA segments thus have different affinities for PhoP-P (Fig. 2).
A faint second band of higher molecular weight was observed for Protect-40, but not for the other targets analyzed here.
All reactions were tested for the requirement for phosphorylation (Fig. 2).
Non-phosphorylated assays are shown (Fig.S2).
No significant binding was observed in absence of phosphorylation.

Using the data obtained with the large fragments, we carried out a sequence alignment analysis of all the fragments shown to bind PhoP-P.
The regions similar to DR1/DR2 and DR3 previously identified in the phoP promoter [26] were observed.

We applied trimming and walking techniques to the initial oligonucleotides to generate subsequent fragments of 50 to 100 bp in size (Fig. 2B, Fig. 3) and proceeded with PhoP-P binding.

The results from the EMSAs on the subfragments were analyzed in the context of the presence or absence of the DR repeats.
In addition to lipFa, we also tested two shorter DNA regions for binding: lipFa1 (-575 to -508) and lipFa2 (-465 to -377).
Binding was observed only with lipFa1, which contains DR1 - 3, at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM, but not for lipFa2.
For pks2, we tested four additional shorter DNA regions: pks2a (-52 to +6), pks2b (-95 to -56), pks2c (+10 to +86) and pks2d (-86 to +15).
Binding was observed for pks2d, which contains a partial DR1 and DR2 - 3 (at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM).
Only very weak binding was observed for pks2a, which contained a DR3 sequence alone (at a PhoP-P concentration of 10 microM), and for pks2b, which contained only DR1 and DR2 sequences (at a PhoP-P concentration of 20 microM).
pks2c which does not contain any of the DRs did not give any binding (Fig. 2B).
We studied msl3a binding in more detail with two additional DNA fragments: msl3a1 (-242 to -198) and msl3a2 (-269 to -188).
Binding was observed for both of these fragments; msl3a2 which contains the entire DR1 - 3 (binding observed at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM), whereas msl3a1 contains only the first 3 bp of DR3 (binding at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM).
Finally, fadD21 was studied by testing two additional DNA regions: fadD21a (-152 to -98), and fadD21b (-145 to -61).
Binding was observed for fadD21b, which contained all three DR sequences (PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM).
Only very weak binding was observed for fadD21a, which contained only DR1 and partial DR2 (PhoP-P concentration of 10 microM), as for pks2b, which also contained only DR1 - 2 (PhoP-P concentration of 20 microM).
However, in assays of PhoP-P binding to Protect40, full binding was observed when we used a DR1 - 2-containing fragment (PhoP-P concentration of 4 microM).
Interestingly, reducing the size of the DNA targets (45 - 102 bp) resulted in a decrease in the protein/DNA ratio (only 1:50) required to obtain a shift, (Fig. 2B), showing that we indeed were able to increase the affinity as we narrowed down the targets to match the DRs.

The transcription initiation sites were determined for lipF, pks2 and msl3 in previous studies [31], [32].
This allowed us to locate DR1, DR2 and DR3 with regard to the transcription start.

We investigated the importance of the repeat motifs in sequence-specific DNA binding by PhoP, using oligonucleotides with altered nucleotide sequences Pho1, Pho2, Pho3 (Table 2, Fig. 2C and 3E) in place of DR1, DR2 or combined DR1/DR2 sequences, respectively whereby we removed one or all of the DR1 - 2 repeats.
The Protect-40 wild-type sequence was used as a control (Fig. 2C).
The Pho1 - Pho3 altered sequences severely impaired PhoP-P binding.
These results confirm that the binding of PhoP to the phoP promoter region is dependent on the direct repeat motifs.



Characterization of the PhoP binding site by DNase I footprinting

We defined the DNA regions binding PhoP more precisely, by carrying out DNase I protection assays on the PhoP-P/DNA target complex.
We used the lipF, pks2, fadD21 and msl3 promoter regions for these protection experiments.
PhoP-P binding enhanced the protection of these four promoters against DNase I digestion (Fig. 4).
The protected regions for pks2, msl3 and fadD21 were approximately 50 to 70 bp long (Fig. 4).
For pks2 and fadD21, these regions include coverage of the DRs, the spacer region between them, with a complete DR3 motif.
In the case of msl3, the DR3 is partially protected until position A7 known for being present in all the DRs (Table 3, [26]).
The protected region of lipF is only 30 - 35 bp in length and the DR3 region is not protected by PhoP protein.



DR sequence analyses

Using two different approaches (see Materials and Methods section), we identified three motifs matching the original DR1, DR2 and DR3 repeats of the PhoP promoter.
These repeats are also present in all target regions upstream the lipF, pks2, msl3 and fadD21 genes (Fig. 5).
The degree of sequence identity to the consensus of the canonical DR1 - 3 motifs of the phoP promoter region [23] ranged from 56% to 89% (Table 3).
DR1 was the most conserved motif, followed by DR2, and then DR3.
The DR1 and DR2 motifs were separated by 1 to 5 bp.
By contrast, DR2 and DR3 were separated by 13 to 35 bp (Fig. 5).
Taking this into account, we analyzed the distribution of the consensus sequences for each motif throughout the MTB genome.
Motif configurations with only DR1 and DR2, or with DR1, DR2 and DR3 were observed in the upstream regions of 87 genes, accounting for 83.9% and 16.1% of total cases, respectively.
The identified genes were analyzed according to the classes of the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) classification [29], [30] (Fig. 6A, Table S1).
We further investigated, using the Tuberculist data, the function of genes that are not listed in COGs (38 genes, Fig. 6B).
Some of the identified genes have already been reported to be regulated by PhoP on the basis of transcriptomic data [20], [21].
Based on the COG classification, we found that PhoP play a key role as a putative transcription regulator mostly for genes involved in transcription (21%) and Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (14%), lipid transport and metabolism (9%), and coenzyme transport and metabolism (9%) (Fig. 6A).

Identification of spd-3 Transcripts

As an initial step to characterize the regulation of spd-3 expression, northern blotting was done using RNA isolated during the post-exponential phase of growth from both the wild-type S. pyogenes strain NZ131 and an rgg mutant.
Two distinct transcripts were detected and both were more abundant in the mutant strain compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 1), which was consistent with our previous finding that Rgg represses spd-3 expression [17].
The more abundant transcript was approximately 925 bp in length and accounted for 65% of the transcript signal, as determined by densitometry.



Mapping the spd-3 Transcriptional Start Sites

Primer extension analysis was used to determine the 5' termini of the two transcripts.
Extension with primer spd3PEc_96 (Table 1) showed a transcript that originated 27 bp upstream of the predicted spd-3 open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 2).
This origin, coupled with a putative transcriptional terminator 91 bp downstream of the spd-3 ORF, predicted a 919 bp transcript, which corresponded to the more abundant approximately 925 bp transcript detected by northern blotting (Fig. 1).
A variety of primers were used in attempts to identify the start site of the longer transcript by using primer extension; however, we were unable to do so, possibly due to secondary structure formed within the large untranslated region.
As an alternative approach, 5' RACE was used and the results showed that the 5' terminus was 594 bp upstream of the spd-3 start codon (Fig 3).
The results predicted a 1,487 bp transcript, which also correlated with the size of the larger transcript identified with northern blotting (Fig. 1).
In addition, the start of transcription coincided with the non-coding DNA region previously shown to be bound by Rgg in vivo during the exponential phase of growth [24].
Analyses of the DNA proximal to the transcriptional start sites revealed the presence of putative -10 and -35 RNA polymerase binding sites (Fig. 3).
The two transcriptional start sites were designated P1 and P2 (Fig. 3).



Rgg Binds Specifically to DNA Containing the P1 and P2 Promoters

ChIP coupled with DNA genechips (ChIP-chip) and gel-shift assays previously showed that Rgg binds to P1[25]; however, we did not previously detect binding to P2.
Therefore, we re-analyzed Rgg binding to both sites by using the more sensitive ChIP-qPCR procedure.
As expected, DNA containing P1 was enriched by approximately 9-fold in strain SA5, which encodes an Rgg-Myc fusion protein used to facilitate immunoprecipitation, compared to the control strain (Fig. 4).
In addition, the P2 region was enriched nearly 75-fold (Fig. 4).
The results show that Rgg binds to both the P1 and P2 DNA (Fig. 4).
Binding near P2 was further evaluated with gel-shift assays and the results confirmed that Rgg specifically binds to DNA containing P2 (Fig. 5).



Rgg Directly Regulates spd-3 Expression

To characterize the two spd-3 promoters further, prophage DNA regions bound by Rgg (P1 and P2) were cloned adjacent to a promoterless firefly luciferase (luc) gene present in the shuttle plasmid pKSM720 [26].
The recombinant plasmids were used to transform both the wild-type and the rgg mutant strains to determine if expression from P1 and P2 was regulated by Rgg.
The use of the plasmid based reporter system also allowed us to measure promoter activity apart from the prophage, thus avoiding confounding factors potentially associated with prophage induction, such as variation in gene copy number.
Promoter activity was detected with P2 DNA and the presence of Rgg in the wild-type strain decreased transcription, consistent with other data indicating that Rgg represses spd-3 transcription (Table 2).
Similarly, a fragment containing both spd-3 promoters (P1 and P2), showed significantly more activity compared to the fragment containing only P2 (Table 2).
Again, more promoter activity was detected in the rgg mutant strain, consistent with Rgg-dependent repression of spd-3 expression by direct binding to the promoter regions (Table 2).



Rgg Acts in cis to regulate spd-3 Promoters

Finally, we used the transcriptional reporter system and ChiP-qPCR to determine if Rgg bound in cis to regulate expression of the luc gene.
One PCR primer was specific to luc and a second was upstream of P1.
The results showed that Rgg bound directly to the plasmid DNA to repress expression of luc (Fig. 6).

IpsA is a novel LacI-type regulator conserved in the Corynebacteriales

IpsA was assigned by homology to the LacI family of transcriptional regulators, which often coordinate the available nutrients with the expression of catabolic genes [16].
The corresponding genomic loci display a remarkable level of conservation across the Corynebacteriales (Figure 1B).
In previous studies, the structure of IpsA (Cg2910) was analyzed (PDB:3H5T); its physiological function is the subject of this study.



IpsA deletion affects cell shape and growth

To gain insight into the function and possible target genes of IpsA, an in-frame deletion mutant was constructed.
Growth rates and final backscatter of DeltaipsA cells were significantly below control levels using minimal medium with glucose as carbon source, and these shortfalls increased in magnitude with successive subcultivation (Figure 1C).
The morphology of the mutant strain was altered, as revealed by fluorescence microscopy with staining of DNA (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)) and membranes (nile red).
DeltaipsA cells formed chain-like structures and failed to divide properly.
DNA in the cells was unevenly distributed and was frequently found in the extracellular space, indicative of severe damage to the cell membrane and/or the cell wall (Figure 1D, for a larger sample see Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Membrane staining revealed several intact cell septa in the unshaped mutant cells.

Both the growth defect and altered morphology could be partially overcome by plasmid-encoded ipsA under control of the native or an inducible promoter (data not shown).
These efforts revealed that increased levels of IpsA also affect growth of C. glutamicum.
Full restoration of the wild-type phenotype was only achieved when ipsA was reintegrated into the mutant strain (intergenic region cg1121 to cg1122) and expressed from its native promoter (Figure 2A, B).
When the cells were cultivated with myo-inositol instead of glucose as carbon source, no differences were observed between the wild-type and DeltaipsA strains in terms of growth and morphology (Figure 1C, D).



The impact of ipsA mutation on transcription

To elucidate the transcriptional changes caused by the deletion of ipsA, DNA microarray experiments were performed.
More than 450 genes showed alterations in mRNA level greater than a factor of 2, using cells in the exponential growth phase (OD600 = 5) cultivated in minimal medium with glucose as carbon source (Additional file 1: Table S3, full data deposited in GEO database [17] under accession number GSE50210).

The expression of the gene cg3323, which encodes a myo-inositol phosphate synthase (ino1), and of the operon (cg0044 to cg0046), which encodes an uncharacterized ABC transporter, was reduced by more than a factor of ten in the mutant strain (Table 1).
Other downregulated genes included a flavin-containing monooxygenase (cg3195), a hypothetical endoglucanase (cg2896), and two further transporters (cg0621 to cg0623 and cg2181 to cg2184) (Additional file 1: Table S3).
Among the strongly upregulated genes was a cluster encoding enzymes for inositol catabolism (cg3389 to cg3392), an operon encoding both menE and a putative integral membrane protein (cg0533 to cg0534), and a putative dinucleotide-binding enzyme (cg1421).
Many of the affected genes are components of the DtxR stimulon, which plays a central role in iron homeostasis in C. glutamicum[18,19].
We speculate that these changes are the result of an impaired iron uptake of the mutant strain due to the defects in the cell wall.
In combination with the observed growth phenotype of the mutant strain, the alterations in gene expression indicate that IpsA is a major regulator of inositol-derived cell wall components.



Identification of direct IpsA target promoters

The microarray experiments revealed several putative target genes of IpsA.
To determine whether these genes are directly regulated by IpsA, the promoter regions of the respective genes were tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) for the formation of complexes with purified IpsA protein.
We analyzed the promoters of all genes that were more than fourfold regulated but excluded ribosomal proteins and genes belonging to the DtxR/RipA regulon.
DNA fragments (approximately 500 bp) covering the promoter regions of putative target genes, were incubated with increasing IpsA-His concentrations.
IpsA-His bound with high affinity to the promoter regions of cg0044 and ino1 (cg3323) and with lower affinity to the promoter regions of cg0534 (a putative integral membrane protein), cg1421 (a putative dinucleotide binding enzyme), cg1476 (thiC, thiamine biosynthesis protein ThiC), cg1918 (a putative secreted protein), and cg3195 (flavin containing monooxygenase) (Figure 3; all tested fragments are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S3).



Determination of the IpsA DNA binding site

Using EMSAs, two separate binding sites were identified in the promoter of ino1 and one in the promoter of cg0044 (Figure 3A and Additional file 1: Figure S4).
Analysis of these sites using the motif-based sequence analysis tool MEME [20] revealed a conserved palindromic motif, which was subsequently verified by mutational analysis (Figure 4).
In particular, the central six base pairs appear to be crucial for IpsA binding.
The preliminary motif was used to search for further binding sites in putative target genes and across the genome of C. glutamicum.
Binding sites were identified by EMSAs using oligonucleotides in the promoters of cg1421, cg3195, cg3210 and cg0534 (Table 1, Figure 3A and Additional file 1: Figure S5).
The identified motifs were used to define the IpsA consensus motif shown in Figure 3C.



Myo-inositol is an effector molecule of IpsA

The enzyme encoded by the main IpsA target gene is Ino1, a myo-inositol phosphate synthase that catalyzes the formation of 1D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate from glucose-6-phosphate [7].
We tested several metabolites involved in the relevant pathway for their influence on the formation of the IpsA-DNA complex.
A clear backshift was observed for myo-inositol but not for 1D-myo-inositol-1-phosphate, 1D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate (Figure 3B).
The effect of myo-inositol could be observed at concentrations down to 0.2 mM (Additional file 1: Figure S6).
This effect is specific for IpsA DNA binding, as the addition of up to 50 mM myo-inositol did not have any effect on the formation of an unrelated protein-DNA complex (for example, AcnR and the acn promoter, Additional file 1: Figure S7).



IpsA is required for inositol-dependent regulation of ino1

The major function of IpsA revealed thus far is the activation of ino1 in the absence of external inositol.
Consistent with this, the growth and cell morphology of the DeltaipsA strain is complemented by the constitutive expression of ino1 under standard conditions (Figure 2C).
To study the influence of IpsA and myo-inositol on the expression of ino1 in vivo, we fused the ino1 promoter to eyfp (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) and monitored the fluorescence output of the wild-type and the DeltaipsA strain during growth on glucose and myo-inositol (Figure 3D).
Strong promoter activity was observed in the wild-type during growth on glucose.
Expression of eyfp was significantly decreased in the ipsA deletion strain and was lower still when either strain was cultivated with myo-inositol as the carbon source.



IpsA function is conserved in C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis

The conservation of IpsA in the Corynebacteriales suggests that it may play a similar role in pathogenic relatives.
To assess this possibility, we tested in vivo complementation of C. glutamicum DeltaipsA with the IpsA homologs of M. tuberculosis (Rv3575) and C. diphtheriae (DIP1969).
Partial complementation of growth and morphology was achieved (Figure 5A-C).
Growth was still slightly retarded but the final OD was significantly increased in comparison with the DeltaipsA strain.
Likewise, the morphological phenotype of the complemented strains fell in between the wild-type and the DeltaipsA strain, with a slightly better complementation by DIP1969 compared to Rv3575.
Most cells displayed the wild-type morphology and, while some chain-like cell clusters were observed (Figure 5C), these were shorter than clusters of the DeltaipsA strain (Figure 1D).

We also tested the binding of IpsA to the promoter regions of C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis homologs of cg3323 and cg0044 using EMSAs (Figure 5D).
C. glutamicum IpsA bound strongly to the C. diphtheriae promoters DIP0115 and DIP0021 and the binding sites were determined (Figure 5E and Additional file 1: Figure S8).
In M. tuberculosis, Rv0046c is organized in an operon with Rv0047c.
A binding site was identified within the open reading frame (ORF) of Rv0047c, suggesting the occurrence of a second promoter upstream of ino1 (Figure 5E).



Mycothiol synthesis is abolished in C. glutamicum del-ipsA

Besides being a precursor of PI and derived lipids, myo-inositol is one of the building blocks of mycothiol, the major antioxidant of Corynebacteria and Mycobacteria.
Therefore, we measured mycothiol in a set of our strains (Figure 6) using a method previously published for C. glutamicum[21].
The mycothiol peak was identified by comparison of wild-type chromatograms with those of a mutant depleted in mycothiol synthesis (DeltamshC).
To proof that the corresponding peak, lacking in DeltamshC, represents mycothiol, thiols were blocked with NMM (N-methyl-maleimide) prior to derivatization with bromobimane.
In this sample, the largest peak of the wild-type at 5.6 minutes was indeed absent the two control samples.
In fact, this mycothiol peak was absent in the DeltaipsA strain but could fully be restored by plasmid-based expression of ipsA (Figure 6).
Interestingly, the mycothiol measurements showed a partial complementation with the ipsA homologs from C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis, which is in line with our previous findings regarding growth and morphology of cross-complemented strains (Figure 5).



PI-based glycolipid synthesis is lost in C. glutamicum del-ipsA

To study the effect of IpsA on the formation of PI-based phosphoglycolipids, [14C]-labeled polar lipids were extracted from wild-type and del-ipsA C. glutamicum.
The glycolipid profiles were examined using two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) (Figure 7).
The wild-type strain showed presence of AcPIM2, PI, Gl-A (GlcAGroAc2) and Gl-X (ManGlcAGroAc2) in lipid extracts as compared to known standards and previous studies [22], isolated from the cells grown with either myo-inositol or glucose.
Under normal conditions, C. glutamicum produces both PI and Gl-X, which is an alternative glycolipid anchor to PI for synthesis of Cg-LM.
The glycolipid Gl-X is derived from Gl-A, its precursor product.
Although both PI and Gl-X can be visualized on TLC analysis, the formation of Gl-X is distinguished only in the case of mutants lacking PI, as both Gl-X and PI do not separate out as distinct spots [23,24].
However, Gl-A appears as a distinct spot on the TLC results in both wild-type and mutant strains.
For convenience, the TLC results for polar lipid extracts from the ipsA mutant defective in PI synthesis have been marked to depict Gl-X at the same position at which PI is depicted in the wild-type and complemented strains.
The labeling for Gl-A remained unchanged.
Interestingly, the complete absence of AcPIM2 was observed in lipid extracts isolated from C. glutamicum del-ipsA when cultured in minimal media supplemented with glucose indicating the loss of PI-based glycolipid synthesis in the mutant (Figure 7B).
The lipid profiles of complemented strains C. glutamicum DeltaipsA::pK18-ipsA and C. glutamicum DeltaipsA harboring cg3323 and DIP1969 in plasmid pAN6, were identical to the wild-type when grown on glucose, demonstrating successful complementation of the loss of gene function in these strains (Figure 7C-E).
However, the lipid extracts from C. glutamicum DeltaipsA harboring Rv3575 in plasmid pAN6 cultured under the same conditions displayed no complementation as none of the components was stained with phosphate stain (results not shown).
The lipid extracts isolated from the mutant and complemented strains cultured in minimal media supplemented with myo-inositol were similar to wild-type, with distinct AcPIM2 and PI production (Figure 7G, H and Additional file 1: Figure S9).



Analysis of lipoglycan extracts

Since the lipoglycans LM and LAM are built on PIMs which are mannosylated products of PI, the effect of IpsA was also studied on these lipoglycans extracted from the wild-type, C. glutamicum del-ipsA and the complemented strains (Additional file 1: Figure S10A).
LAM and Cg-LM-A/B were clearly present in extracts from the wild-type cultured in glucose or myo-inositol.
However, the lipoglycan extracts from the mutant C. glutamicum del-ipsA grown on glucose revealed no LAM while a band corresponding to Cg-LM-B could be observed.
On glucose the complemented strains C. glutamicum DeltaipsA::pK18-ipsA and C. glutamicum DeltaipsA containing plasmid encoded Cg3323 and DIP1969 exhibited lipoglycan profiles identical to the wild-type as distinct bands corresponding to both LAM and Cg-LM-A/B.
However, no band corresponding to LAM was observed in lipoglycan extracts of C. glutamicum DeltaipsA complemented with Rv3575c in pAN6 plasmid grown in minimal media supplemented with glucose.
Instead, a band corresponding to Cg-LM-B was evident.
The lipoglycan extracts isolated from the mutant and complemented strains cultured in minimal media supplemented with myo-inositol were similar to wild-type with distinct LM and LAM (Additional file 1: Figure S10B).

Prediction of Fur boxes in the genome of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090

Construction of the IRIS chips required a set of double strand DNA probes containing target sequences.
To design the dsDNA probes, we first predicted Fur binding sequences (Fur boxes) throughout the genome using a bioinformatics approach.
Neisseria Fur boxes previously defined by DNase I foot printing studies were utilized to avoid the mismatches caused by the species-specific nucleotides in Fur boxes of different bacteria (Table S1).
A total of 198 Fur boxes in the intergenic regions throughout the gonococcal genome were predicted in this study (Table S5).
Due to the fact that transcription of Fur regulated genes responds to iron availability, we focused on the iron-regulated genes identified via microarray analyses [50], [51] of N. gonorrhoeae cultured under iron-replete and iron-deplete conditions.
Forty-five iron-repressed genes with predicted Fur boxes in their promoter regions (Table S3) were identified, which included 18 out of 21 of the previously identified Fur-repressed genes/operons in N. gonorrhoeae[52].
This consistency validated our prediction of Fur binding sequences in the gonococcal genome.
Twenty-two Fur binding sequences were predicted in the promoter regions of 21 iron-induced genes in this study (Table 1) including 2 previously identified Fur-activated genes, NGO0711 and NGO1751 [8].



Interactions of Fur with predicted consensus sequences in N. gonorrhoeae

We next characterized in vitro binding of the Fur protein to predicted Fur boxes in the promoter regions of iron-induced genes using our high-throughput, label-free technology-IRIS.
As shown in Figure 1A, Fur binding to the probes containing a predicted Fur box demonstrated a concentration dependent increase in differential spot height (DSH).
The Fur boxes in the promoter regions of fur, norB and nspA, which have different binding affinities to Fur (26.1 nM, 1.2 nM and 724.8 nM, respectively) were utilized as positive controls and the sequences in the aniA promoter as a negative control [8].
EMSA previously demonstrated that while the aniA gene contains a predicated Fur box, the Fur protein does not bind to this region [8].
Consistently, Fur binding to the known Fur boxes in fur and norB promoter regions reached 4.8 +- 0.5 and 5.4 +- 0.9 nm increase in differential spot height, respectively, when 200 nM Fur protein was added (Figure 1A).
These mass density increases corresponded to 3.8 and 3.6 Fur dimers binding to one dsDNA molecule, respectively (Figure 1B).
The differential spot height of the nspA Fur box probe continued to increase with Fur protein concentrations from 2.8 +- 0.4 nm, 3.5 +- 0.1 nm to 4.4 +- 0.1 nm (Figure 1A).
Two Fur dimers, 2.6 dimers and 3.0 dimers/nspA Fur box were detected when 200 nM, 400 nM and 800 nM Fur protein were added to the chips, respectively (Figure 1B).
As the negative control, the aniA promoter sequences showed a small mass density increase for the three concentrations of Fur protein (DSH&lt;1 nm) (Figure 1A).
Therefore, we defined a threshold value for a DSH of GTEQ 1 nm as a cutoff for determining specific Fur binding to dsDNA probes.

According to the above analytical criteria, a large number of tested predicted Fur boxes (14 out of 18) in the promoter regions of iron-induced gonococcal genes displayed specific binding properties to the Fur protein, while 4 predicted Fur boxes failed to bind to Fur.
Specifically, NGO1683 and NGO1745 did not show increased DSH for any concentration of Fur protein (Figure 1A).
The DSHs of predicted Fur boxes in NGO302 and NGO0377 promoter regions were only ~1 nm (1.0 +- 0.06 nm and 1.0 +- 0.02 nm, respectively) when 800 nM Fur protein was added (Figure 1A), suggesting that these two predicted sequences did not bind to Fur according to the defined criteria.
In contrast, the other 14 predicted Fur boxes showed variable binding properties to Fur.
The predicted Fur boxes in the NGO0436 and NGO1738 promoter region displayed DSH values of 1.4 +- 0.05 nm and 2.0 +- 0.2 nm, respectively when 800 nM Fur was added (Figure 1A), corresponding to 0.8 dimer/dsDNA molecule and 1.6 Fur dimers/dsDNA molecule, respectively (Figure 1B).
When 400 nM Fur was added, the predicted Fur boxes in the promoter regions of NGO1284, NGO1845 and NGO1948 showed DSH values of 1.7 +- 0.03 nm, 1.7 +- 0.3 nm and 1.7 +- 0.07 nm, respectively, which all corresponded to 0.5 Fur dimers/dsDNA molecule (half amount of dsDNA is bound by Fur dimers) (Figure 1A and B).
The Fur boxes in the promoter regions of NGO0155, NGO0304, NGO0899 and NGO1189 had DSH values of 1.9 +- 0.1 nm, 2.0 +- 0.1 nm, 2.2 +- 0.1 nm and 2.0 +- 0.03 nm, respectively (Figure 1A).
These DSH values corresponded to approximately one Fur dimer/dsDNA molecule (Figure 1B).
When 200 nM Fur was added, the predicted Fur boxes in NGO0101, NGO0641 and NGO1419 promoter regions had DSH values of 1.9 +- 0.4 nm, 2.0 +- 0.1 nm and 1.9 +- 0.4 nm, respectively which correlated to one Fur dimer/dsDNA (Figure 1A and B).
The two highest binding affinities were observed for predicted Fur boxes in NGO0073 and NGO1957 promoter regions.
When 200 nM Fur was added, DSH values of these two Fur boxes were 3.5 +- 0.4 nm and 2.9 +- 0.1 nm, respectively, corresponding to 3 Fur dimers and 1.5 Fur dimers/dsDNA molecule, respectively (Figure 1A and B).

To further validate Fur binding properties of the predicted Fur boxes characterized with IRIS, we performed traditional EMSA on two of the newly identified Fur bound probes, NGO0073 and NGO0101.
Fur binding to the predicted Fur boxes in NGO0073 and NGO0101 promoter regions was specific as determined by a cold competition assay (Figure 2A).
Consistent with the binding affinity trend estimated using IRIS, the apparent KD's of Fur binding to Fur boxes of fur gene, NGO0073 and NGO0101 calculated using EMSA results were 31.8 +- 7.9 nM, 39.8 +- 6.3 nM and 406.1 +- 144.8 nM, respectively (Figure 2B).
The combination of these results supports IRIS as an accurate method to determine the specificity and affinity of Fur binding to an array of immobilized dsDNA sequences.

Of interest among the 18 tested predicted Fur boxes in the promoter regions of iron-induced genes, fourteen were shown to bind to Fur specifically in vitro (Table 1).
No information about Fur binding to these promoter regions was known previously, highlighting the power of IRIS in identifying novel promoters bound by Fur.



New targets directly regulated by Fur

We next examined the regulatory role of Fur in transcription of iron-induced genes containing a functional Fur box in the promoter regions using quantitative RT-PCR of N. gonorrhoeae wild type, fur mutant, and fur complemented strains.
This analysis revealed 5 new Fur regulated genes [NGO0155, NGO0436, NGO0641, NGO1738 and NGO1957] (Figure 3, Table 1).
An iron bound Fur-repressed gene, fbpA[6], [53], was used as a control for Fur and iron regulation.
We observed a statistically significant increase (5-fold) in fbpA transcript levels in the fur mutant strain grown under iron-replete conditions as compared to the wild type strain grown under iron-replete conditions.
AS expected we observed restoration of Fur mediated repression in the fur complemented strain (Figure 3).
Transcription of NGO0155 was up-regulated in the fur mutant strain compared to the wild type strain under iron-replete (+Fe) conditions, and was partially restored in the fur complemented strain (Figure 3), suggesting that iron-bound Fur directly represses transcription of NGO0155.
Transcriptional levels of NGO0436 and NGO1738 were reduced in the fur mutant strain compared to those in the wild type strain and partially restored in the fur complemented strain grown under iron-replete conditions (Figure 3), suggesting that NGO0436 and NGO1738 are directly activated by iron-bound Fur.
Transcription levels of NGO0641 and NGO1957 were up-regulated in the fur mutant strain compared to the wild type strain under iron-deplete conditions (-Fe) and were restored in the fur complemented strain (Figure 3).
This transcriptional pattern was similar to that previously observed in apo-Fur mediated repression [15], [16].

Transcriptional levels of nine genes, NGO0073, NGO0101 (Figure 3), NGO0304, NGO0899, NGO1189, NGO1284, NGO1419, NGO1845 and NGO1948, showed no difference in expression among the three strains (Table 1, Figure S2).
This suggests that these genes are not regulated by Fur under the growth conditions in this study.
However, due to the fact that Fur specifically binds to promoter regions of these genes with high affinities, we termed this phenomenon "silent Fur binding" in N. gonorrhoeae.

IscR activates K. pneumoniae CPS biosynthesis in an Fe-S cluster-dependent manner

To study whether IscR regulates K. pneumoniae CPS biosynthesis, we determined the amounts of K2 CPS in CG43S3 (wild type [WT]) and AP001 (DeltaiscR) strains.
Compared with the WT, AP001 produced significantly lower amounts of CPS (Fig. 1A), suggesting that IscR activates the biosynthesis of CPS.
In K. pneumoniae, IscR contains three highly conserved cysteine residues (C92, C98, and C104 in E. coli IscR) which are thought to coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster [20].

To investigate the role of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in IscR regulation of CPS biosynthesis, we created an iscR mutant AP002 (iscR3CA) by replacing the three cysteines with alanines and tested whether this mutant, which is predicted to encode an IscR lacking an Fe-S cluster, affected CPS biosynthesis.
As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that the amount of CPS decreased in the AP002 strain compared with that in the WT, indicating that the regulation of IscR required the [2Fe-2S] cluster.
Moreover, iscR and iscR3CA were respectively cloned into pACYC184, to yield pIscR and pIscR3CA, for complementation analysis.
Compared with AP001 [pACYC184], AP001 [pIscR] produced a significantly higher amount of CPS, whereas the introduction of pIscR3CA into the AP001 strain did not change the CPS amount (Fig. 1B).
These results confirmed that IscR has a positive role in the regulation of CPS biosynthesis and that the presence of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of IscR is essential for this regulation.
On the other hand, the CPS amount appeared to obviously increased in AP001 [pIscR], compared with that in WT [pACYC184] (Fig. 1B), which may result from multicopy plasmids are used for complementation.
Therefore, we also used single copy constructs to complement the iscR-deletion (Methods S1), and the result showed that the expression of iscR, but not iscR3CA, could restore the CPS biosynthesis (Fig. S1).

The K2 cps gene cluster of K. pneumoniae contains 19 open reading frames (ORFs) organised into 3 transcription units - namely, orf1 - 2, orf3 - 15, and orf16 - 17[22].
To determine the role of IscR in regulating cps transcription, we used the reporter plasmids pOrf12 (Porf1-2::lacZ), pOrf315 (Porf3-15::lacZ), and pOrf1617 (Porf16-17::lacZ), each carrying a promoterless lacZ gene transcriptionally fused to the putative promoter region of the K2 cps gene cluster [23], to transform the K. pneumoniae strains AP006 (DeltalacZ), AP007 (DeltalacZ-DeltaiscR), and AP008 (DeltalacZ-iscR3CA).
The measurements shown in Fig. 1C reveal that the promoter activity of orf1 - 2 and orf16 - 17 in AP007 and AP008 was lower than that in AP006 (P&lt;0.01).
Additionally, the promoter activity of orf3 - 15 was apparently decreased in AP008 but slightly decreased in AP007 compared with that in AP006.
These results indicated that IscR activates the transcription of cps genes in an Fe-S cluster-dependent manner.



IscR directly binds the promoter of galF

For further investigation of the mechanism of IscR regulation on cps transcription, the sequence of the putative IscR binding site was manually analysed in the three promoter regions of the K2 cps gene cluster.
As shown in Fig. 2A, we found a putative type 1 IscR box with 52% (13/25 bp) homology to the consensus sequence located between -173 bp and -197 bp relative to the translational start codon of galF (orf1 in the K2 cps gene cluster).
In addition, the putative IscR binding sequence in PgalF was highly homologous to the IscR-binding motif (5'-AxxxCCxxAxxxxxxxTAxGGxxxT-3') reported by Nesbit et al. [21].
However, no typical IscR binding site was found in the upstream sequence of wzi (orf3 in the K2 cps gene cluster) or manC (orf16 in the K2 cps gene cluster), suggesting that IscR indirectly regulates the promoter activities of orf3-15 and orf16-17, which remains to be studied.
On the other hand, we hypothesised that IscR binds directly to the promoter region of galF to activate gene transcription, and we confirmed this by performing an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2B, purified recombinant IscR::His6 protein was able to bind PgalF-1 but not PgalF-2, in which the region containing the putative IscR binding site was deleted.
In addition, compared with that of IscR::His6, the recombinant [2Fe-2S] clusterless IscR3CA::His6 had reduced PgalF-1 binding activity.
Furthermore, no obvious interaction between the recombinant IscR proteins and PgalF-1*, the galF promoter lacking only the 25-bp predicted IscR box, was found (the lower panel of Fig. 2B).
Besides, PgalF-1 and PgalF-1* DNA showed a slightly different mobility in the gel.
These results suggested a direct interaction between IscR and the galF promoter and that the [2Fe-2S] cluster of IscR plays a crucial role in this interaction.
On the contrary, we also analysed whether recombinant IscR::His6 could bind the promoter regions of wzi and manC.
As expected, EMSA showed no obvious DNA-protein complex (data not shown).



Effect of IscR on normal human serum resistance

Because CPS acts as a protectant for K. pneumoniae against serum factors, we hypothesize that through modulation of CPS levels, IscR affects the ability of K. pneumoniae to resist the bactericidal effects of serum.
To test this hypothesis, we treated K. pneumoniae strains with 75% normal human serum and determined their survival rates.
Compared with the WT, the AP001 and AP002 strains had a slightly reduced survival rate (Fig. 3A), implying a positive role for [2Fe-2S]-IscR in the serum resistance of K. pneumoniae.
To confirm this result further, we performed a complementation study.
As shown in Fig. 3B, the introduction of pIscR, but not pACYC184 or pIscR3CA, into the AP001 strain increased the bacterial survival rate, to a similar level compared with that of WT [pACYC184], after serum treatment.
These results supported the hypothesis that [2Fe-2S]-IscR activates the expression of CPS to increase K. pneumoniae resistance to normal human serum.



IscR has a regulatory role in iron acquisition systems

In E. coli, both Fur and IscR play important roles in the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis [12], [13].
To analyse whether IscR regulates iron acquisition in K. pneumoniae, we performed a chrome azurol S (CAS) assay to assess siderophore secretion in K. pneumoniae strains.
As shown in Fig. 4A, no apparent siderophore secretion was detected in the WT, AP001, or AP002 strains.
Moreover, as in our previous report [10], deletion of fur clearly increased halo formation on the CAS plate.
However, the halo was reduced in the AP003 (Deltafur) strain background by the further deletion of iscR, indicating the positive role of IscR in iron acquisition.
Furthermore, no obvious difference in siderophore secretion was found between the AP003 and AP005 (Deltafur- iscR3CA) strains, suggesting that the IscR regulation of iron acquisition does not require the [2Fe-2S] cluster.

To verify whether apo-IscR activates iron acquisition, we introduced pACYC184, pIscR, or pIscR3CA into the AP004 (Deltafur-DeltaiscR) strain and performed a CAS assay.
As shown in Fig. 4B, the introduction of both pIscR and pIscR3CA increased the halo phenotype on the CAS plate compared with that of the vector-only control.
These results confirmed that IscR activates siderophore secretion in a [2Fe-2S] cluster-independent manner.

To further investigate the regulatory effect of IscR on iron acquisition, we used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to measure the expression of genes corresponding to the eight putative iron acquisition systems in the indicated K. pneumoniae strains.
As shown in Table 1, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of genes (fhuA, iucA, and sitA) corresponding to three iron acquisition systems were increased more than 2-fold in the AP005 strain as compared with that in the AP004 strain.
To further confirm this result, pACYC184, pIscR3CA, or pIscR were respectively introduced into the AP004 strain, to avoid the effects of Fur, and the transcription of fhuA, iucA, and sitA were measured.
The introduction of pIscR3CA into AP004 apparently increased the transcription of fhuA, iucA, and sitA compared with that in the AP004 strain carrying pACYC184 only (Table 1).
These results implied that apo-IscR activates the transcription of fhu, iuc, and sit to increase iron acquisition in K. pneumoniae.
Besides, the introduction of pIscR into AP004 also slightly increased transcription of fhu, iuc, and sit (Table 1).



IscR3CA directly binds the promoter region of fhuA, iucA, and sitA

Apo-IscR has been demonstrated to bind the type 2 IscR box in IscR-regulated promoter sequences directly in E. coli[19].
Analysis of the promoter regions of fhuA, iucA, and sitA revealed consensus sequences of the E. coli type 2 IscR box.
As shown in Fig. 5A, the predicted type 2 IscR boxes are located at -154 to -130 relative to the translation start site of fhuA and -67 to -43 relative to the translation start site of iucA.
The predicted type 2 IscR boxes in PfhuA and PiucA have 50% (13/26 bp) and 46% (12/26 bp) homology, respectively, with the consensus sequence.
In addition, two putative type 2 IscR boxes (R1 and R2) located at -112 to -87 and at -53 to -28 relative to the translation start site of sitA were found in PsitA.
The R1 and R2 sites contain 50% (13/26 bp) and 61.5% (16/26 bp) homology, respectively, with the consensus sequence.

To verify whether apo-IscR binds to these predicted type 2 IscR boxes, we performed an EMSA.
As shown in Fig. 5B - D, both the purified IscR::His6 and IscR3CA::His6 were able to bind with the promoter regions of fhuA, iucA, and sitA, and IscR::His6 appeared to contain higher binding activities.
Furthermore, IscR3CA::His6 did not bind PfhuA-2 and PiucA-2, which lacked a region containing a putative IscR box (Fig. 6B - C).
We also found that IscR3CA::His6 did not bind PiucA-2, which contained the R1 site but not the R2 site (Fig. 6D).
To further confirm the importance of these predicted IscR boxes, recombinant IscR proteins were respectively interacted with these promoters lacking only the 26-bp predicted type 2 IscR box (PfhuA-1*, PiucA-1*, and PiucA-1*), and no obvious interaction was found.
These results suggested that apo-IscR interacts directly with the promoters of fhuA, iucA, and sitA via the predicted type 2 IscR boxes.



Regulatory control of iscR transcription in K. pneumoniae

To analyse whether environmental iron availability affects K. pneumoniae iscR expression, we grew AP006 in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with increasing amounts of the iron chelator 2, 2-dipyridyl (Dip) and monitored the promoter activity of iscR using a LacZ reporter system [23].
As shown in Fig. 6A, the addition of 250 or 500 microM Dip to the growth medium increased iscR promoter (PiscR) activity by approximately 2-fold and 3.9-fold, respectively, indicating that the transcription of the iscRSUA operon was activated by iron limitation.

In K. pneumoniae, Fur and RyhB reportedly play crucial roles in gene regulation in response to cellular iron levels [10], [11].
Thus, we investigated whether Fur and RyhB regulate the activity of PiscR.
As shown in Fig. 6B, the deletion of fur and the further deletion of ryhB in AP006 strain had no obvious effects on PiscR activity, whereas the deletion of iscR in AP006 strain activated PiscR activity by approximately 4.5-fold.
In E. coli, IscR has been demonstrated to exert negative auto-regulation which requires the [2Fe-2S] cluster [20].
Thus, we measured PiscR activity in an AP006-derived strain, AP008 (DeltalacZ-iscR3CA), expressing a mutated IscR predicted to be defective in cluster binding [20].
As shown in Fig. 6B, the PiscR activity in AP008 was increased approximately 4.5-fold.
This increase was comparable to that in AP007 (DeltalacZ-DeltaiscR).
Our results suggested that IscR inhibits the transcription of the iscRSUA operon in a [2Fe-2S] cluster-dependent manner in K. pneumoniae.

To investigate whether IscR is the sole regulator of iscRSUA transcription in response to iron availability, we monitored PiscR activity in the AP007 and AP008 strains in LB broth containing various levels of iron.
As shown in Fig. 6C, the PiscR activity in AP006 was activated in LB broth supplemented with Dip, and the further addition of 100 or 250 microM FeSO4 reversed the activation.
In the AP007 and AP008 strains, PiscR activity was increased compared with that of AP006.
Nevertheless, the addition of Dip still activated PiscR activity, suggesting the presence of unknown factors, and the further addition of FeSO4 restored the effect.

To analyse whether Fur is responsible for this regulation, we measured PiscR activity in AP011 (DeltalacZ-Deltafur-DeltaiscR) compared with that of AP007 at various iron levels and noted no obvious effect.
These results indicated that in addition to IscR and Fur, other factors modulate the transcription of the iscRSUA operon in response to environmental iron availability.

Overview of RNA-Seq data analysis of the OpaR regulon in V. parahaemolyticus

A screening RNA-Seq analysis established the full scope of the V. parahaemolyticus OpaR regulon by comparing the transcriptome of V. parahaemolyticus LM5312 (opaR+) and LM5674 (del-opaR1).
The total RNA extracted from LM5312 and LM5674 had RNA integrity values (RIN) of 9.8 and 10 respectively.
Following rRNA depletion, approximately 30 million 50-bp transcripts were obtained for each sample corresponding to an average gene coverage of more than 300 times.
Greater than 15% of the genome showed a two-fold or greater change in expression between the opaR+ and del-opaR1 samples (Fig 1).
Similar to what had been observed in the microarray comparison [13], OpaR activated genes involved in capsular polysaccharide production and the type VI secretion system located on chromosome 2 (T6SS2), and repressed the type III secretion system 1 located on chromosome 1 (T3SS1), type VI secretion system 1 (T6SS1), and the lateral flagellar regulon.
Chromosome 1 has a total of 2848 predicted genes, of these 237 were activated two-fold or greater by OpaR and 219 were repressed at least two-fold.
Chromosome 2 has 1600 potential genes, 206 genes were activated and 128 genes were repressed two-fold or more.
The RNA-Seq data confirmed that OpaR plays a significant role in global regulation of gene expression in V. parahaemolyticus BB22OP as had been previously demonstrated via microarrays using an Affymetrix GeneChip designed to the V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 strain [25].
The microarray data and RNA-Seq data showed a high degree of similarity (S1 Fig).
Only 18 genes appeared to exhibit expression changes in opposite directions for these two platforms (S3 Table).
Since six of the discordant genes from chromosome 2 were phosphate transport related and two of the discordant genes from chromosome 1 were DNA uptake related genes, it is likely that most of these minor differences in expression may be attributed to subtle differences in growth conditions.

Genes that are unique to V. parahaemolyticus BB22OP and not found in V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 were also analyzed to determine what limitations had been imposed on the BB22OP transcriptome analysis by using the RIMD2210633 GeneChip.
Twenty-four genes that were regulated four-fold or greater by OpaR and had greater than 50 reads for at least one of the sequencing reactions were identified as being unique to BB22OP (S4 Table).
Three of these genes are on chromosome 2 and 21 are on chromosome 1.
Of the 21 unique OpaR-regulated genes on chromosome 1, fourteen are found in an integron region that is unique to the BB22OP strain [16].
Twenty-one of the 24 unique genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins, whereas the other three genes encode a putative lipase, an acetyltransferase and a halogenase.

NCBI BLAST was used to analyze the homology of 21 genes encoding hypothetical proteins to determine if a function could be assigned.
VPBB_1425 shares 74 of its 132 base pairs with the gene for an Rhs-family protein found in V. parahaemolyticus UCM-V493 with the locus tag VPUCM_1621.
However, the Rhs-family protein in UCM-V493 is 960 bp suggesting that VPBB_1425 may be truncated.
VPBB_2301 matches 116 bp of its 117 bp to a 117 bp gene encoding glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase in V. parahaemolyticus O1:Kuk str.
FDA_R31 with the locus tag M634_14765.
This suggests that VPBB_2301 should also be annotated as encoding glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase.



Identification of transcriptional regulators in the OpaR regulon and validation of their expression via qRT-PCR

The RNA-Seq data (S4 Table) and microarray data (previously published [13]) were analyzed for OpaR-controlled transcription factors that were differentially expressed four fold or greater between the LM5312 (opaR+) and LM5674 (del-del-opaR1) strains, using at least one of the two approaches.
Eleven transcription factors were chosen for further study as described above (Table 1) and qRT-PCR was performed to validate the changes in gene expression observed in the Illumina sequencing.
Two separate RNA samples extracted independently of the sample generated for RNA-Seq analysis were used.
The expression of the 16S rRNA coding region was used as reference to normalize expression of other genes.
Although the ratios of change in expression obtained via RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR differed slightly, all genes displayed similar trends in regulation (activation vs. repression) (Table 1).
The two control genes, rpoD and fliAP, had been previously demonstrated to be constitutively expressed in V. parahaemolyticus BB22OP regardless of OpaR function [13].



EMSA analysis of OpaR-controlled transcription factors

A bioinformatics search using the PATSER program [28] and a previously published LuxR family binding sequence [27] identified putative binding sites upstream of eight of the 11 genes encoding transcription factors (Table 2).
Two of the genes, VPBB_1558 (encoding the T3SS1 regulator ExsA) and VPBB_A0869 (encoding an ArsR-family regulator), appeared to be at the beginning of operons with predicted OpaR-binding sites directly upstream of the transcription factor; whereas three of the regulatory genes, VPBB_1307 (encoding an FhlA-family transcription factor), VPBB_1322 (encoding an AsnC-family regulator), and VPBB_A1405 (encoding the flagellar regulator LafK), are located within operons with the potential OpaR-binding site not directly upstream of the gene encoding the transcription factor (Fig 2).
Three genes, VPBB_0645 (encoding a Crl-family regulator), VPBB_2619 (encoding the low-cell density regulator AphA), and VPBB_A1319 (encoding the capsule regulator CpsQ), are not part of an operon and have the putative binding site directly upstream of the start site.
It was predicted that OpaR would not bind the promoter regions of VPBB_0491(encoding another capsule regulator CpsR), VPBB_2530 (encoding a CsgD/VpsT-family regulator), or VPBB_A0554 (encoding an AraC-family regulator) because they lacked potential binding sites.
Most of the PATSER scores for the eight candidate binding sites were between three and five (Table 2).
Only three transcription factor genes, aphA, exsA, and lafK, had upstream putative binding sites for OpaR with PATSER scores greater than seven, which is the default setting for significance in PATSER.

Remarkably, the EMSA analysis demonstrated that OpaR bound nine of the 11 target promoters (Fig 3).
Thus, the weaker scoring OpaR-binding sites appear to be functional.
This was clearly illustrated by the multiple shifted bands observed in several of the promoters.
The MQSR matrix [27] utilized with PATSER, in combination with the RNA-Seq data selecting for highly regulated genes, appeared to be quite effective in identifying possible OpaR-binding sites since even sequences with low scores appeared to be valid based on the EMSA results.
OpaR did not bind the promoter region of VPBB_2530 and VPBB_A0554 (Fig 3), which were two of the three genes that lacked predicted binding boxes.
However, it did bind to the promoter of VPBB_0491 with no predicted OpaR-binding site, illustrating that there are limits to the ability of the bioinformatics tools to identify all possible OpaR targets.
This in part may be due to the fact that the MQSR matrix is not specific for OpaR, since binding sites for multiple LuxR homologues were used to design it.
Nevertheless, for the purpose of this study, the MQSR matrix did serve as a useful tool to identify putative target genes for further EMSA analysis.



Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data to identify additional OpaR direct targets

Since the bioinformatics method was quite effective in identifying putative OpaR targets, a second purely theoretical bioinformatics approach was applied to the RNA-Seq data in an effort to identify more OpaR direct targets.
First, a list of genes with a five-fold or greater change in OpaR-dependent expression was generated.
The more stringent five-fold cut off was used to help decrease possible false positives.
This initial list was then cross-referenced with 2702 putative OpaR-binding sites with a PATSER score of 3 or higher identified by the PATSER program using the MQSR matrix with the RIMD2210633 genome [31].
The RIMD2210633 genome was utilized since it was already accessible in the PATSER program and there were only five unique BB22OP genes with greater than five-fold differential OpaR-dependent expression.
This analysis yielded a list that included eight of the 11 transcription factors of interest and 60 additional OpaR-controlled genes that may have OpaR-binding sites in the V. parahaemolyticus BB22OP genome (S5 Table).

The 60 newly identified genes, not including the eight transcription factors, can be classified into nine different categories.
Sixteen genes appear to encode hypothetical proteins, nine encode methyl-accepting chemotaxis related proteins, seven encode cell surface related proteins, seven encode transporter proteins, seven encode regulatory or metabolic enzymes, three genes encode lateral flagellar proteins, five encode proteins with domains predicted to be involved in c-di-GMP synthesis or degradation, and one gene encodes the polar flagellar protein FlhA.
There are five remaining genes that do not classify into one of the above categories: VPBB_1560 (encoding type III secretion regulator ExsC), VPBB_1309 (encoding type VI secretion Hcp protein), VPBB_1336 (encoding SM-20-related protein), VPBB_1851 (encoding cytochrome c4), and VPBB_2845 (encoding putative signal peptide protein).
While further analysis of these putative direct targets of OpaR was beyond the scope of this study, their identification suggests that OpaR may directly control a variety of genes in V. parahaemolyticus.

After the BB22OP genome sequence became available in the PATSER database, an analysis of the promoter regions of the five unique BB22OP genes regulated five-fold or more by OpaR was similarly performed.
Using these criterion, results indicated only one gene specific to BB22OP as being theoretically directly regulated by OpaR.
VPBB_A0413 is a gene encoding a hypothetical protein with a PATSER score of 7.8 and opaR+/DeltaopaR1 RNA-Seq regulation of 0.11.
The predicted OpaR binding site is -412 to -393 upstream of the start site (S5 Table).



Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data to identify putative sRNAs

Outputs from two different published databases, BSRD [30] and sRNApredict2 [29], that utilized the V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 genome, were initially compared to help identify sRNAs predicted to also exist in BB22OP.
For Chromosome 1, sRNApredict2 predicted 50 candidate sRNAs, BSRD predicted 45, but only 14 were predicted by both programs.
The sRNApredict2 program identified 42 possible sRNAs for chromosome 2, while BSRD predicted 20, with only six predicted by both programs.
Both programs successfully predicted the five Qrrs believed to control OpaR translation [29,30].

The BB22OP RNA-Seq data validated expression of several predicted sRNAs described above in at least one of the two strains examined.
RPM values were computed for each of the predicted sRNAs sequences from the two RNA-Seq samples, revealing six predicted sRNAs found in one or both of the sRNA databases that were differentially regulated greater than four-fold by OpaR (Table 3).
Four of the six sRNAs were too small for efficient qRT-PCR validation, and since all of them were already deposited into public databases, no additional analysis was performed.
The BB22OP RNA-Seq data was also analyzed for differential expression of novel sRNAs not predicted by the two databases by looking for the pileup of reads mapping to intergenic regions.
Two candidates were discovered to be possible OpaR controlled sRNAs.
One appears to be a 5' untranslated region upstream of gene VPBB_1422 rather than a distinct sRNA.
VPBB_1422 (VP1517) encodes an Rhs-family protein; its upstream region was similarly regulated in the microarray analysis (~34-fold).
The second candidate has all the characteristics of a sRNA.
This putative sRNA, called Srr, is located between genes VPBB_1217 and VPBB_1218 on the VP B22OP chromosome 1.
The Srr RNA was previously identified as being part of the lateral flagellar regulon and was repressed 73-fold by OpaR [13,25].
The RNA-Seq data showed Srr as being repressed 222.69 +- 1.54 fold by OpaR (Table 3).
The existence of this novel sRNA was verified, and OpaR-control of its expression was validated when subsequent qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated 167.93 +- 62.92-fold repression by OpaR.
Thus, along with the transcripts of the lateral flagellar genes, it is one of the most highly regulated transcripts in the entire OpaR regulon.

Identification of promoter-like DNA sequence elements between two convergent genes

The starting point for this work was our previous analysis of global CRP binding in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) [11].
This work predicted a CRP target between the convergent genes aatC (encoding a subunit of a transport system) and tnpA (encoding a transposase).
The genomic context of the CRP site is shown in Fig 1A and the surrounding DNA sequence is shown in Fig 1B.
We searched the locus for promoters that may be under the control of CRP.
A sequence (5'-TAACCT-3') that resembled a promoter -10 hexamer was found close to the CRP site within the aatC coding region (Fig 1B).
A 189 bp ORF, which we named aatS, and a ribosome binding site (RBS) were also identified (Fig 1B).
Note that aatS fully overlaps aatC but is in the opposite orientation.
We considered that the overlap might result from aatC being annotated incorrectly.
However, on close examination, this seems unlikely; there is no alternative stop codon within the aatC open reading frame.
Furthermore, the full aatC sequence is conserved in numerous bacteria.



PaatS is a CRP-dependent promoter in vivo

Our next aim was to determine if the putative promoter upstream of aatS (PaatS) was functional.
Thus, a 134 bp DNA fragment containing the sequence shown in Fig 1B, flanked by EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites, was generated.
The DNA fragment, named aatS1, was cloned upstream of lacZ in plasmid pRW50 to create a PaatS::lacZ fusion.
Next, E. coli M182 and the Deltacrp derivative were transformed with the resulting plasmid.
Transformants were cultured in liquid media and RNA was isolated as a template for primer extension.
A 166 nucleotide primer extension product was observed using RNA from M182.
Conversely, little extension product was observed using RNA from the Deltacrp derivative (compare lanes 5 and 6 in Fig 2A).
Thus, the aatS transcription start site (marked "+1" in Fig 1B) is located 4 bp downstream of the putative aatS promoter -10 hexamer.
Furthermore, PaatS is poorly active in the absence of CRP.
Consistent with our primer extension analysis, PaatS controlled expression of lacZ was also significantly reduced in cells lacking CRP (P = 0.018; Fig 2B).



PaatS is a CRP dependent promoter in vitro

We next confirmed activation of PaatS by CRP using in vitro transcription assays.
The aatS1 DNA fragment was cloned upstream of the lambdaoop transcription terminator in plasmid pSR.
Thus, the transcript generated from PaatS is expected to be 169 nucleotides (nt) in length.
Note that, pSR also encodes RNAI; a 108 nt factor independent transcript derived from the plasmid replication origin.
Thus, we observed two bands on denaturing PAGE gels (Fig 2C).
As expected, synthesis of RNAI did not require CRP.
However, production of the larger 169 nt aatS transcript was stimulated by CRP.



CRP binds a site overlapping the PaatS -35 element

To confirm CRP binding to the predicted target upstream of PaatS we used DNAse I footprinting.
The result of the experiment is shown in Fig 3.
Lane 1 shows the banding pattern resulting from DNAse I cleavage of aatS1 in the absence of CRP.
Alterations to this pattern are evident in lanes 2 - 6 as increasing concentrations of CRP are added.
Thus, CRP induced the appearance of three hypersensitive bands (starred) and protected the flanking DNA regions (underlined).
The footprint aligns precisely with the predicted DNA target for CRP.
The CRP site is 39.5 bases upstream of the PaatS transcription start site (Fig 1B).
However, we note that the aatS mRNA start is 4 bp, rather than the usual 7 bp, downstream of the promoter -10 element.
Hence, CRP is well positioned to interact with RNA polymerase via a standard class II mechanism.



The aatS coding region is preceded by a functional ribosome binding site

The predicted aatS ORF is located 82 bp downstream of the aatS transcription start site, within the coding region of aatC.
We noticed that the 5' end of the aatS mRNA contains a sequence, 5'-UUAAGAAGU-3', that resembles a RBS (5'-UAAGGAGGU-3') [20, 21].
In addition, the predicted aatS RBS is located 6 bp upstream of the aatS start codon, a position suitable for translation initiation [22].
To determine if the RBS was functional, we created a translational aatS1::lacZ fusion and explored the effects of mutating the RBS on lacZ expression.
Thus, we generated a derivative of the aatS1 fragment, called aatS2, where the sequence of the RBS was altered to 5'-UUUUCUUCA-3' (Fig 4).
Both aatS1 and aatS2 were translationally fused to lacZ by cloning into pRW225 [23].
Resulting plasmids were used to transform M182 and the Deltacrp derivative.
LacZ activities were then determined in lysates of transformants grown in liquid culture (Fig 4).
LacZ expression was significantly reduced when the aatS RBS was mutated (P = 0.011).
Residual LacZ expression, driven by the aatS2::lacZ fusion in M182Deltacrp cells, was not significantly different from background LacZ activity (P = 0.096).
Background LacZ activity was obtained using M182Deltacrp transformed with pRW225 having no promoter insert.



AatS contains a conserved domain of unknown function

We cannot exclude the possibility that PaatS drives transcription of a small or antisense RNA.
However, the presence of a functional RBS, appropriately positioned upstream of the aatS open reading frame, is consistent with the transcript being an mRNA.
If this is the case, translation would result in the production of a 62 amino acid AatS peptide.
To better understand AatS we used BLAST to identify 38 microbial proteins with a significantly similar sequence (E-value &lt;10) in the NCBI blastp database.
The search also reveals that AatS shares 67% identity with a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF1602, E-value: 4.07e-7).
Genes encoding DUF1602 are found in diverse species in all kingdoms of life (Table 3).
Strikingly, as in the case of aatS, genes encoding DUF1602 are often genetically associated with, and occasionally overlap, genes encoding transport systems.
We conclude that aatS may encode a small protein that could be an ancillary subunit of the Aat transport system in ETEC.

LexA targets a novel LexA-binding motif in the Verrucomicrobia

The presence of core SOS response operons (lexA [VSP_RS04780], recA [VSP_RS32310], and imuA-imuB-dnaE2 [VSP_RS05590-VSP_RS05595-VSP_RS05600]) in the genome of the representative Verrucomicrobia species V. spinosum DSM 4136 indicates that this phylum might possess a functional LexA regulatory network.
However, computational searches using known LexA-binding motifs did not yield putative LexA-binding sites upstream of any SOS related genes in V. spinosum.
Taking advantage of the availability of multiple genome and metagenome assemblies for the Verrucomicrobia phylum, we compiled 116 promoter sequences from 59 different assemblies corresponding to orthologs of the V. spinosum DSM 4136 lexA, recA, and imuA genes through the JGI-IMG service (Supplementary Material 2).
We then used MEME to identify overrepresented motifs in these sequences.
The most significant motif identified by MEME (Figure 1A) is a 14 bp palindromic motif with consensus sequence (TGTTC-N4-GAACA).
This motif was identified in the promoter region of 27 lexA genes, 25 recA genes, and 3 imuA genes, corresponding to 36 different genome and metagenome assemblies and spanning all three major groups of Verrucomicrobia (Supplementary Material 3).
A computational search also identified instances of this motif in the promoter sequences of the V. spinosum DSM 4136 lexA, recA, and imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operons (Figure 1B).
The TGTTC-N4-GAACA motif is reminiscent of the LexA-binding motif (GAAC-N4-GTTC) previously reported in the Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Gallionellales (Davis et al., 2002; Au et al., 2005; Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2015).
Together with its structural similarity to previously reported LexA-binding motifs, the presence of this motif in the promoter region of multiple orthologs for three core components of the SOS response strongly suggested that the identified TGTTC-N4-GAACA motif is the LexA-binding motif of the Verrucomicrobia.

To validate that the palindromic motif identified in silico was the LexA-binding motif of V. spinosum, we purified the V. spinosum DSM 4136 LexA protein [WP_009959117] and performed electro-mobility shift assays (EMSA) with wild-type and mutant versions of the V. spinosum DSM 4136 recA promoter containing single-nucleotide substitutions at each position of the predicted LexA-binding motif.
The results of this site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 1C) are in broad agreement with the motif predicted in silico, confirming that V. spinosum LexA targets a spaced dyad motif with consensus sequence TGTTC-N4-GAACA.
Single-nucleotide mutations to the bases of the inverted repeat regions (TGTTC and GAACA) of the V. spinosum LexA-binding motif systematically abolish LexA binding in the recA promoter context, indicating that these conserved elements likely correspond to the monomer binding site and are therefore essential for LexA binding activity (Groban et al., 2005).
In contrast, the 4 bp spacer region and 3 bp flanking regions tolerate single-nucleotide mutations, suggesting that they are predominantly involved in indirect readout and DNA bending (Zhang et al., 2010).

Previous work has established that the alpha3 helix of the N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif is responsible for the majority of the specific contacts with monomer binding sites of LexA-binding motifs (Oertel-Buchheit et al., 1990; Ottleben et al., 1991; Thliveris and Mount, 1992; Groban et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2010).
Comparison of the alpha3 helix sequence in Verrucomicrobia LexA proteins with previously reported LexA alpha3 helix motifs (Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2015) shows that the Verrucomicrobia LexA alpha3 helix is most closely related to those of the Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria.
As shown in Figure 2, the majority of the changes observed in the alpha3 helix of Verrucomicrobia localize to the N-terminal part of the helix, affecting residues that change sequence specificity through direct readout, but that are not essential for DNA bending and structural motif recognition (Oertel-Buchheit et al., 1990; Thliveris et al., 1991; Thliveris and Mount, 1992; Groban et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2010).
Furthermore, the overall distribution of hydrogen donors and hydrophobic residues is preserved across the entire alpha3 helix (Supplementary Material 4).
These observations suggest that the structural similarities between Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motifs are the result of an evolutionary process in the LexA DNA-binding motif that has modified the specific readout of monomer sites without altering the recognition of the overall motif structure.



The Verrucomicrobia LexA protein targets tandem binding sites in LexA promoters

Close inspection of the V. spinosum lexA promoter reveals a poorly conserved LexA-binding site immediately downstream (1 bp) of the putative LexA-binding site identified in silico (Figure 3).
To confirm that both these putative motif instances are involved in LexA binding, we performed EMSA with purified V. spinosum LexA protein on the lexA promoter.
The results shown in Figure 4A revealed the distinct formation of two retardation bands on the lexA promoter at low protein concentrations, corresponding to LexA binding at either one or the two LexA-binding sites identified in the lexA promoter.
Further, increasing protein concentration resulted in a single retardation band corresponding to LexA recognizing both LexA-binding sites.
Taken together, these results indicate that the two identified LexA-binding sites in the promoter region of the V. spinosum lexA gene are bound cooperatively by LexA.
A systematic analysis of the promoter regions of V. spinosum lexA gene orthologs in the Verrucomicrobia revealed that more than half of the lexA ortholog promoters with predicted LexA-binding sites display similar tandem site configurations (Supplementary Material 5).
Most of these tandem arrangements involve a conserved TGTTC-N4-GAACA motif instance followed by a degenerate site in which only the first TGTTC element is conserved, but a tandem site arrangement with both conserved sites can be observed in at least two species (Figure 3).

In Opitutus terrae PB90-1, there are two fully conserved Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motifs in the promoter region of a putative lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operon [OTER_RS20480-OTER_RS20475-OTER_RS20470-OTER_RS20465] separated by 2 bp.
This arrangement generates an instance of the canonical GAAC-N4-GTTC LexA-binding motif of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.
Using purified O. terrae and B. subtilis LexA proteins, we performed EMSA to validate the functionality of this tandem arrangement in O. terrae (Figure 4).
EMSA with O. terrae LexA [WP_012376858] reveals two retardation bands at low protein concentration, confirming that this protein also binds to both Verrucomicrobia LexA target sites in the lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 promoter (Figure 4B).
Mobility assays with incremental concentrations of B. subtilis LexA [WP_003238209] show that B. subtilis LexA binds a unique element in the O. terrae lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 promoter, yielding a single retardation band similar to the one observed on the B. subtilis recA [BSU16940] promoter (Figure 4C).
These results suggest that B. subtilis LexA binds the Firmicutes-like LexA-binding motif instance generated by the tandem arrangement of Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding sites.



The core Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon comprises three operons involved in DNA repair and mutagenesis

Having established the LexA-binding motif of the Verrucomicrobia, we performed a comparative genomics analysis of the LexA regulon in this phylum.
We compiled 15 whole-genome shotgun assemblies for members of all the major classes of Verrucomicrobia (Opitutae, Spartobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiae) presenting a V. spinosum LexA homolog and searched for putative LexA-binding sites in the promoter region [-250, +50] of predicted operons.
The results of the comparative genomics analysis (Figure 5; Supplementary Materials 6, 7) reveal a core LexA regulon present in all classes of the Verrucromicrobia phylum and composed of three operons: lexA, splB, and imuA-imuB-dnaE2.
The lexA gene displays high-scoring sites in all the analyzed species, except for Verrucomicrobium sp. 3C (TaxID: 1134055), Verrucomicrobia bacterium LP2A (TaxID: 478741), and Pedosphaera parvula Ellin514 (TaxID: 320771).
The LexA proteins of these species display significant changes to the alpha3 helix of the LexA DNA-binding domain, suggesting that they may target a divergent LexA-binding motif.
Consistent with this result, the genomes of these organisms do not reveal any instance of the Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motif in the promoter regions of previously documented SOS genes (Erill et al., 2007).
The promoter region of the splB gene shows evidence of LexA regulation in several Verrucomicrobiae, one Opitutaceae (O. terrae) and the only available assembly of a Spartobacteria species (Chthoniobacter flavus Ellin428; TaxID: 497964).
The product of the splB gene contains a radical SAM domain (PFAM04055) and has homology to COG1533 (ENOG4105DCH), classified as a DNA repair photolyase.
Members of this orthologous group have been reported to be regulated by LexA in the Actinobacteria, the Gammaproteobacteria, the Betaproteobacteria, and the Alphaproteobacteria (Davis et al., 2002; Cirz et al., 2006; Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2012, 2015; Ulrich et al., 2013), suggesting that it may be a previously unrecognized core component of the SOS response.
Lastly, the promoter region of the imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operon presents Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motif instances in C. flavus and the same Verrucomicrobiae species as splB.
As noted above, O. terrae presents a putative lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 with verified O. terrae LexA binding in its promoter region (Figure 4).
Even though the intergenic distance between lexA and imuA is larger than the genomic average for this species (264 bp), the prevalence of lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 arrangements across the Bacteria domain suggests that this direction constitutes a functional operon in O. terrae (Erill et al., 2006).



The Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon is highly variable and incorporates novel functions

The results of the comparative genomics analysis reveal remarkable variation in the size and composition of the inferred LexA regulon.
In the Verrucomicrobiae, the predicted regulon ranges from one operon (Verrucomicrobia bacterium IMCC26134; TaxID: 1637999) to over 14 (V. spinosum), with several species displaying intermediate sizes [2 operons in Rubritalea marina DSM 17716 (TaxID: 1123070) or 5 in Haloferula sp. BvORR071 (TaxID: 1396141)].
The only available Spartobacteria representative (C. flavus) shows a moderate regulon size (5 operons).
In contrast, the LexA regulon appears to have shrunk noticeably in the Opitutaceae, where it encompasses at the most two operons.
Two members of this family [O. terrae and Opitutaceae bacterium TAV5 (TaxID: 794903)] present a duplication of the lexA gene.
The products of the two Opitutaceae TAV5 lexA genes (OPIT5_RS22040 and OPIT5_RS25725) present 91% identity and their promoter regions contain almost identical LexA-binding sites.
The lexA genes in O. terrae (OTER_RS20480 and OTER_RS11645) have diverged substantially (42% protein sequence identity) and only the promoter of the lexA1 gene (OTER_RS20480) presents Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motif instances, following the tandem arrangement discussed above (Figure 3).

The overall composition of the inferred Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon is in broad agreement with experimental and computational descriptions of the SOS regulatory network in other phyla (Erill et al., 2007; Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2012, 2015).
Beyond the core regulon described above (lexA, splB, imuA-imuB-dnaE2), the Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon encompasses genes coding for the recombination protein RecA (COG0468; ENOG4105C68), the excinuclease ABC subunits A (COG0178; ENOG411DGUH) and B (COG0556; ENOG4105CCW), two DNA helicase RecQ homologs (COG0514; ENOG4107QS5 and ENOG410QKP1) and two homologs of the error-prone DNA polymerase IV (COG0389; ENOG4105CCW and ENOG4105CQ3).
In addition to these previously established SOS genes, the Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon shows evidence of regulation for an operon encoding proteins matching the TIGR03916 (ENOG4105ES7) and TIGR03915 (ENOG4105T12) models.
These models are present in about 20% of sequenced bacterial genomes, arranged always in operon configuration, and are thought to constitute a DNA base excision repair system involving a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) domain that is conserved in all Verrucomicrobia TIGR03915-matching homologs.

To validate the predictions of the comparative genomics approach and further establish the LexA regulon of the Verrucomicrobia, we performed EMSA with purified V. spinosum and O. terrae proteins on the promoter region of several genes with predicted LexA-binding sites in these organisms and evidence of regulation in at least three different genomes.
The results, shown in Figure 6, confirm that LexA binds to the promoter region of the splB gene in O. terrae (OTER_RS07185) and V. spinosum (VSP_RS12190).
V. spinosum LexA also binds the imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operon promoter, the promoters of genes coding for DNA polymerase IV (VSP_RS08510) and RecQ (VSP_RS32195) homologs, and the recA (VSP_RS04780) and uvrA (VSP_RS32650) promoters.
Together with the comparative genomics analysis, these results confirm the existence of a conserved core LexA-regulon in the Verrucomicrobia and demonstrate that, in some Verrucomicrobia species, LexA controls a network of similar size and function to those reported in well-studied bacterial phyla, using a novel LexA-binding motif.

In this study, the presence of major known bacterial virulence factors in Sphingomonas wittichii was investigated.
Phylogenetic relationships among 74 species of genus Sphingomonas, including the human pathogen Sphingomonas paucimobilis were reconstructed.
Figure 1 shows the Partial 16SrDNA based Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree for all 74 species of the genus Sphingomonas.
This figure also shows that Sphingomonas wittichii is a relatively close taxon to S. starnbergensis, S. histidinilytica, S. parapaucimobilis, S. yabuuchiae and the human pathogen S. paucimobilis.
The pair wise genetic distance analysis was performed which showed the overall value of distance analysis among Sphingomonas species to be 0.05.
The individual values of pairwise distance between of S. wittichii with S.sanguinis, S. histidinilytica, S. parapaucimobilis, S. paucimobilis, S. yabuuchiae and the distantly related species S. mali were 0.016, 0.026, 0.048, 0.042, 0.042 and 0.06 (Supporting information Table 1) respectively.
The S. starnbergensis is a novel type of freshwater bacterium isolated from the prealpine mesotrophic Starnberger See (Bavaria, southern Germany).
This species showed 95.3 % sequence similarity with S. paucimobilis DSM 1098(T), the type species of the genus Sphingomonas [14].
While, the S. histidinilytica was isolated from an open hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) dump site at Ummari village in Lucknow, India.
It showed 16S rDNA similarity of 99.4 %, with Sphingomonas wittichii DSM 6014(T) [15].
Moreover, S. yabuuchiae was identified from samples taken from the Russian space laboratory Mir.
As shown in our results (Figure 1), S. yabuuchiae 16S rDNA sequence formed a coherent cluster with Sphingomonas sanguinis, Sphingomonas parapaucimobilis, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Sphingomonas roseiflava with sequence similarity of 97-5 - 98-6% [16].
Sphingomonas wittichii also came in a coherent cluster with S. parapaucimobilis and S. paucimobilis, the only two species that are considered of human clinical significance [17].


The Maximum Likelihood method was used to construct a phylogenetic tree using partial 16S rDNA sequences of selected pathogenic bacteria as mentioned above in (Figure 2) and this was specifically done in order to make a guided decision for the choice of pathogenic bacteria species that will be used in the following comparative genomics analysis with Sphingomonas wittichii.
This phylogenetic tree showed that Brucella sp. was the closest bacterial taxon to Sphingomonas, followed by Helicobacter spp., Campylobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., and then Legionella sp.
Based on these suggested phylogenetic relationships, the following bacterial species, Brucella sp., Helicobacter sp., Campylobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Legionella sp, were selected for further comparative genomic and bioinformatics analysis.


Table 1 shows the selected bacterial genera with its corresponding species, hosts, and the diseases.
All the chosen pathogens were mainly human, animal, protozoa, and plants pathogens.
(Table 2) shows the virulent factors acquired by the chosen pathogens that were tested for its presence in S. wittichii genomic information.
The major categories of bacterial virulence factors include adherence, endotoxin production, adherence, mobility, secretion systems and quorum sensing.


Table 3 and Figure 3 presents the shared virulence factors among S. wittichii and the selected five bacterial pathogens.
Results in Table 3 showed that S. wittichii shares the genes accountable for intracellular survival capability (manC and pgm) with Brucella sp. with e-values ranging from 0 to 3.00E-09 [11,12,13].
In addition, Sphingomonas spp., shares the genes encoding for Type IV secretion system such as BMEII0026 with Brucella sp. with e-value of 6.00E-04 and identity similarity of 90%.
On the contrary, S. wittichii does not share any virulence factors with Helicobacter spp. or Campylobacter sp. despite their close phylogenetic relationship.
Moreover, S. wittichii shared Legionella sp. genes accountable for adherence and motility, namely, htpB and flip.
In addition, S. wittichii and Legionella sp. shared the gene responsible for stress tolerance and sodB.
The sodB encodes for superoxide dismutase which is a cytoplasmic iron superoxide dismutase important for intracellular survival and transmission [18].


Notwithstanding of the phylogenetic divergence between S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp., it was noticed that they share several major virulence factors such as, adherence antiphagocytosis, iron uptake, proteases, quorum sensing.
S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. shared 19 genes of flagella formation (adherence) including flgK with e-value of 1.00E-04 and identity similarity of 94% and flgF with e-value of 6.00E-05 and identity similarity of 89%.
The Flagella formation plays an important role as a virulence factor that enable motility toward the infection site, biofilm formation and several other pathogenic adaptations [19,20,21,22,23].
Moreover, S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. shared many genes implicated in type IV pili biogenesis and mechanical function of pili, such as fimU with e-value of 3.00E-04 and pilB with e-value of 3.00E-04 and 93% identity similarity.
The type IV pili system plays an important role in adherence by assisting the pathogens to attach with their host cells and the twitching motility that allows the bacteria to move along the cell surface and in biofilm formation [20, 24,25,26,27,28].
Moreover, they shared two genes waaG and waaP implicated in lipopolysaccharide production that also play role in adherence ability.
Additionally, S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. share many genes implicated in antiphagocytosis through alginate production.
They shared six alginate genes including algJ with e-value of 7.00E-04 and identity similarity of 94% and alg44 with e-value of 7.00E-04 and identity similarity of 85%.
Alginate production allows pathogens to form bacterial biofilms and contributes to the persistence of bacteria in the lung by acting as an adhesin, which prevents the bacteria from being expelled from the infection site.
The alginate slime layer makes it more difficult for phagocytes to ingest and kill the bacteria [29,30,31,32,33].


Another important bacterial virulence factor shared between S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. is quorum-sensing ability.
S. wittichii has both rhlL and rhlR with e-values of 3.00E-4 and 5.00E-9, respectively.
Thus S. wittichii possess only rhl system of quorum sensing.
Whilst in Pseudomonas sp. quorum sensing consists of two separate but interrelated systems, namely; las and rhl which are found to regulate the production of multiple virulence factors and are also crucial for proper biofilm formation [34,35,36].
In addition, S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. share seven genes encoding for xcp secretion system (Type II secretion system) including xcpX and xcpR with e-values of 1.00E-5 and 3.00E-174, respectively.
The xcp secretion system is found to be responsible for secretion of toxins and enzymes into the extracellular fluid [37,38].
It was also observed that both S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. share several genes involved in Iron uptake using both Pyochelin (10 genes) and Pyoverdine (4 genes).
The Pyochelin is effective at enhancing iron uptake in P. aeruginosa, catalyzes the formation of tissue-damaging free radicals and also binds other transition metals (e.g. Mo (IV), Co (II)) with appreciable affinity and is also implicated in the delivery of both Co (II) and Mo (IV) to P. aeruginosa cells [39,40].
The Pyoverdine is effective at acquiring iron from Transferrin and Lactoferrin.
Moreover, Pyoverdine is cytotoxic due to its ability to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species [41,42].


Since production of bacterial toxins is very important aspect of virulence, we extended our comparative analysis in order to investigate the presence of toxin related genes in S. wittichii.
Table 2 shows toxins that were found to share between S. wittichii and Bordetella pertussis, the strictly aerobic Gram-negative coccobacilli pathogen.
B. pertussis is a strict human pathogen causing whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease marked by severe, spasmodic coughing episodes [43,44,45].
It was also observed that S. wittichii contains genes for Invasive Adenylate cyclase /haemolysin, cyclolysin secretion protein which is a bi-functional toxin harboring both adenylate cyclase and hemolytic activities and functions primarily as an antiinflammatory factor [46,47,48].
Moreover, Sphingomonas spp. contains genes responsible for Pertussis toxin and its secretion system which assists in the attachment of B. pertussis to ciliated respiratory cells, important immunogen and activate cyclic Adenosine Phosphate (cAMP), Histamine Sensitising Factor (HSF), Lymphocytosis Promoting Factor (LPF), Islet-activating protein (IAP), interferes with leucocyte function and is haemolytic [49,50,51][52,53].


Results of this study showed that S. wittichii contains several major virulence factors mainly resembling Pseudomonas sp. 
Other virulence factors from Legionella sp., Brucella sp. and Bordetella sp., have also been observed.
Moreover, the similarity of virulence factors did not correspond to the phylogenetic relationships.
These findings suggest horizontal gene transfer of virulence factors rather than sharing a common pathogenic ancestor.
The other possible scenario is that S. wittichii went through a reductive evolution process that attenuated its pathogenic capabilities.
In both cases we suggest that lots of care must be taken when releasing S. wittichii higher concentrations in the process environmental remediation.

Inactivation of esi promotes the epothilone production in S. cellulosum So0157-2

Using the conjugation and subsequent homologous recombination protocols as previously described [38], we inactivated genes flanking the epothilone gene cluster in S. cellulosum So0157-2 to determine whether they were associated with the synthesis, regulation or modification of epothilones.
The SCE1572_25030 gene locates approximately 500 bp upstream to the epothilone promoter (Fig. 1a).
We amplified an internal fragment of the gene and cloned it into the pCC11 plasmid [38] to construct the inactivation vector, which was introduced into the genome of So0157-2.
The gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis, which was confirmed by amplification using Tail-PCR and sequencing of the insertion region.

We fermented the mutant and the wild type strain in 50 mL of EMP medium supplemented with 2% of XAD-16 resin [16].
After 7 days of shaking cultivation, the resin was harvested, and the absorbed compounds were extracted for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis to determine the yields of epothilones.
The results showed that the insertion mutation of SCE1572_25030 resulted in a remarkable increase in the yields of epothilones A and B, from 2.2 and 1.4 mg/L in the wild type strain to 4.7 and 10.1 mg/L in the mutant (Fig. 1b; t test, p value &lt;0.01).
The total yields of epothilones A and B increased approximately 4.1 times, from 3.6 to 14.8 mg/L.
The results suggested that the SCE1572_25030 gene probably encoded an epothilone synthesis inhibitor (Esi).
The mutant strain was termed as So0157-2-esi-.



The presence of esi gene suppresses the epothilone production in M. xanthus

Due to the genetic manipulation difficulty in S. cellulosum cells, we investigated influences of the esi gene on the production of epothilones in M. xanthus.
We previously integrated the So0157-2 epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster randomly into M. xanthus genome by transposition; and the esi gene upstream to the epothilone gene cluster was also included in the transferred fragment [22].
We chose the ZE9 transformant derived from M. xanthus DZ2 for the assay.
Bioinformatics analysis indicated that there was no homologous sequence of esi in DZ2, which was further confirmed by PCR amplification of an esi fragment against the DZ2 genome.
Firstly, we deleted the esi gene from ZE9, producing the knockout mutant ZE9Deltaesi.
The ZE9 and ZE9Deltaesi strains had similar growth curves in CYE medium (Fig. 2a).
Methyl oleate is able to greatly increase the epothilone production ability in Myxococcus cells [39].
When fermented in the CYE medium supplemented with methyl oleate (CMO medium), the two strains showed different production abilities of epothilones.
After 6 days of incubation, the yields of epothilones A and B increased 72.4 and 24.2%, and the total yields of epothilones were 9.9 mg/L in ZE9 and 13.7 mg/L in ZE9Deltaesi, respectively (Fig. 2b).
The deletion of esi significantly increased the production of epothilones in Myxococcus cells (t test, p value &lt;0.01).

Furthermore, we constructed an esi-overexpressing mutant strain ZE9 att::esi by using plasmid pSWU30-p630-esi to introduce an additional esi gene into the attB site of ZE9 genome.
Using the same process, the empty plasmid pSWU30-p630 was also introduced into ZE9, forming the ZE9 att::Tet strain as a control.
These two strains were inoculated in CYE medium supplemented with 5 mug/mL tetracycline for 48 h, which were used as seeds to inoculate fresh CYE medium to assay their growth curves.
The results showed that the ZE9 att::esi and ZE9 att::Tet strains also had a similar growth curve as the ZE9 strain (Fig. 2a).
However, the introduction of an additional esi gene obviously suppressed the epothilone production (9.9 mg/L in ZE9 vs. 5.5 mg/L in ZE9 att::esi; t test, p value &lt;0.01), whereas the ZE9 att::Tet had a similar epothilone yield as ZE9 (t test, p value &gt;0.05) (Fig. 2b).
Accordingly, Esi is a negative regulator for the production of epothilones, functioning not only in the producing Sorangium strains, but also in Myxococcus.



Esi negatively regulates the transcription of epothilone biosynthetic genes

To investigate the regulation mechanism of Esi on the production of epothilones, we comparatively analyzed the transcriptional levels of epothilone biosynthetic genes in the esi-deletion and overexpression mutants with their parent strain M. xanthus ZE9 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
In ZE9 strain, compared with the expression of the epoA gene, the esi gene expressed at a low level (Fig. 3).
In the early growth stage (24 h of incubation), expression of the esi gene was approximately 21% of the epoA gene; then weakly decreased with the increase of incubation.
After the growth, the expression level of esi gene was greatly decreased, remaining less than 2% of the 24 h-expression at the 60 h of incubation (the stable stage of the growth curve, referred to Fig. 2b).
Comparatively, in the ZE9 att::esi mutant, the additional esi gene was under the control of the 630-bp promoter of pilA, which held the total expression level of esi at high levels.
The esi expressions at the 24, 48 and 60 h were 4.35-, 3.16- and 2.70-fold of that at the 24 h in the ZE9 strain (Fig. 3).

Similar to that in our previous report [22], transcriptional levels of the epothilone biosynthetic genes markedly varied in ZE9.
With the increase of incubation time, transcriptions of the seven ORFs in the gene cluster each increased approximately ten times during the growth stage from 24 to 48 h, and then rapidly decreased in the following 12 h (Fig. 3).
The transcriptional pattern was consistent with the production curves of epothilones in M. xanthus cells [22] or S. cellulosum cells [16], which was different from other microbial secondary metabolisms, usually expressed in stationary growth phase [2, 4].

After the deletion of the esi gene, the transcriptional level of each of the seven epothilone ORFs was markedly up-regulated at different incubation time points (t test, p value &lt;0.05 or p value &lt;0.01) (Fig. 3).
The transcriptional increases ranged from 99% (epoF) to 200% (epoC) at 24 h, 88% (epoF) to 574% (epoD) at 48 h and 124% (epoD) to 611% (epoB) at 60 h of incubation.
However, with the overexpression of esi, the epothilone genes were correspondingly down-regulated in the ZE9 att::esi strain (Fig. 3).
The above RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that Esi negatively regulated the transcription of epothilone genes.



The structure model of Esi and its potential regulation mechanism

It is known that the repression of transcription initiation often occurs simply by steric hindrance [29].
From the above results, we suggested that the esi protein product probably functioned by directly binding on the epothilone promoter sequence to block the transcription.
Esi (WP_020736929.1) is a protein with 373 amino acids in size.
Domain prediction by the SMART program showed that the protein had no signal peptide or transmembrane domain.
We constructed the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Esi protein using the I-TASSER and QUARK programs.
All the structural models were refined at the atomic level by using the fragment-guided molecular dynamics (FG-MD) simulations.
Based on the constructed model, the Esi protein contained three regions, i.e. an N-terminal domain, a linker region and a C-terminal domain, with the isoelectric points of 6.90, 5.87 and 5.95, respectively (Fig. 4a).
The 106-aa N-terminal domain had three parallel beta-pleated sheets and three alpha helixes, the 248-aa C-terminal domain was a Cupin-like domain (pfam13621), and the linker region was an alpha helix (Fig. 4b).
According to the quality assessment by Ramachandran plot (Additional file 1: Figure S1), the accuracy of protein structural models (80.6% of the residues in favored region) was acceptable [40].

The repressors, usually in dimer or further multimer form, bind to the operator sequence of promoter and thus block the transcription; and most operators contain direct or inverted repeats of a 4 - 5 base pair sequence for the binding [34].
We further constructed potential DNA - protein complex structure.
We reconstructed a 3D structure of the epothilone promoter using w3DNA, and then calculated to determine the best complex structure of Esi-promoter by using nucleic acid-protein dock (NPDock).
The results suggested that the N-terminal domain of Esi connected with the promoter DNA sequence (Fig. 4c).
We checked the promoter sequence and found a special 17-bp DNA sequence (-137 to -153 bp relative to the transcriptional start site), which contains a 4-bp inverted repeat sequence (Fig. 1a).
According to the DNA - protein complex structure, we suggested that the inverted repeat was the best Esi-binding region.
The Esi protein might work as a dimer, and the two N-terminal domains bind specifically to the inverted GGGA of the double-strand promoter DNA sequence.



Esi negatively regulates on epothilone promoter sequence

In our previous report, we revealed that a 24-bp fragment in the epothilone promoter probably played a regulation role for the RNA polymerase functions [36].
Interestingly, this fragment includes the specific inverted repeat sequence.
To determine the molecular mechanism of Esi regulation on the epothilone synthesis, we assayed the binding activity between Esi and the 17-bp operator DNA sequence of epothilone promoter.
We constructed the esi gene into the expression vector pET-28a, forming pET-28a-esi, which was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.
The Esi protein was tagged with a 6-His sequence.
After induction with 0.1 mM IPTG, the Esi proteins were extracted from the cultivated cells, and purified based on the fused His-tag (Fig. 5a).

The double-strand 17-bp sequence was obtained by PCR annealing with the primers labeled with biotin.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) was performed to detect the specific binding activity of Esi and the 17-bp sequence.
Each of the reaction system contained biotin-labeled DNA and LightShift (TM) Poly (dI - dC).
The results clearly showed that the His-Esi protein was able to bind to the biotin-labeled DNA.
If the molar ratio of protein and DNA was increased, the more DNA was blocked (Fig. 5b), which indicated that the His-Esi protein bound specifically with operator DNA, rather than the nonspecific competition DNA (Poly dI - dC).



Existence of esi gene in bacteria

Using the Esi amino acid sequence as a seed, we iteratively searched the homologous sequences in RefSeq database using the psi-BLAST program, and found 156 Esi-homologues with more than 90% of alignment coverage.
The genes encoding for the 156 Esi homologous proteins distributed in 203 different bacterial genomes (Additional file 2: Table S1), all belonging to the Proteobacteria.
These genomes contained single esi gene copy, except Pseudomonas fluorescens FW300-N2C3, which contained two genes encoding for the Esi homologous proteins.
The esi gene distributed mainly in Pseudomonas (143 of the 203 genomes), Acinetobacter (41 genomes) and Burkholderia (6 genomes).
Surprisingly, among more than 20 sequenced myxobacterial genomes, the esi gene was only found in the Stigmatella aurantiaca strain DW4/3-1 and the S. cellulosum strains So0157-2 and So0163.
The results indicated that the Esi regulation mechanism was not universal in myxobacteria.

All of the Esi proteins had a length ranging from 356aa to 419aa, and their functions have not been reported, indicating that the esi gene codes a novel negative regulator.
The evolutionary conservation of each amino acid residue in the Esi homologue proteins was calculated using ConSurf [41], which showed that the C-terminal domain had the highest conservation, followed by the N-terminal domain and the linker region (Additional file 3: Figure S2).
Because of high similarities of their amino acid sequences, these homologous proteins were suggested to have similar 3D structures as the Esi protein described in this paper, probably playing functions as transcriptional regulation factors like the Esi protein.

Differences in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns between A56-1S and A56-1R

We selected the MEM-resistant E. coli strain A56-1R from A56-1S by culturing on LB agar supplemented with 1 mg/L MEM (Table 1).
The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of A56-1S and A56-1R were tested using the agar dilution method and a Vitek2 instrument (Table 3).
A56-1S was resistant to CAZ, CTX, GEN, CIP and SXT, and exhibited high or intermediate susceptibility to IPM, MEM, AMK and FOF (Table 3).
The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of A56-1R was similar to that of A56-1S with the exception of its response to CAZ, IPM and MEM (Table 3).
For example, the MEM MIC of A56-1R was over 256-fold higher than that of A56-1S.
Both A56-1S and A56-1R tested positive for blaIMP-6 and blaCTX-M via PCR amplification.



Differences in IMP-6 MBL production and blaIMP-6 transcript levels between A56-1S and A56-1R

Differences in carbapenemase expression between A56-1S and A56-1R was tested by qRT-PCR of blaIMP-6 and the Carba NP test.
The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the blaIMP-6 transcript level was 53-fold higher in A56-1R compared to A56-1S (Fig 1A).
In the Carba NP test, A56-1S was negative and A56-1R was positive for carbapenemase production (Fig 1B).
Therefore, carbapenemase production by these strains correlate with the observed meropenem susceptibility (Table 3).



Comparative genome analysis between A56-1S and A56-1R

To analyze the difference in blaIMP-6 transcript levels between A56-1S and A56-1R, whole-genome sequencing was performed using NGS.
The chromosomal and plasmid DNA were separated by S1 nuclease PFGE, and one chromosomal and three plasmid bands were observed for both strains (data not shown).
We observed that the blaIMP-6-positive plasmids pA56-1S (GenBank ID: AP018362) and pA56-1R (GenBank ID: AP018363) were part of the IncN incompatibility group and carried other antimicrobial resistance genes (blaCTX-M-2, sul1, aadA2, tetA), a class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1), and a conjugative transfer operon (Fig 2).
Upstream of blaIMP-6 are located the promoters of intI1 and ardK on pA56-1S and pA56-1R, respectively (Fig 2).
A pairwise homology alignment showed that the proportion of homologous regions (at GTEQ 99% nucleotide identity) between pA56-1S and pKPI-6 of Klebsiella pneumoniae KPI-6 strain (GenBank ID: AB616660 [9]) was 90.6% (Fig 2), suggesting that these plasmids share a common backbone.

There is a 791-bp difference in sequence length between pA56-1S (53,198 bp) and pA56-1R (53,989 bp) due to an additional IS26 element that was transposed into the alleviation of restriction of DNA (ardK) coding sequence on pA56-1R, along with IS26-mediated inversion (Fig 2).
This additional IS26 element and the associated inversion caused disruption of the ardK gene, the product of which ArdK, is predicted to be a transcription factor belonging to the family of transcriptional repressor TrfB, as determined by its amino acid sequence using InterPro (similar to protein motif IPR032428).
No sequence variations were identified in the chromosomal and other blaIMP-6-negative plasmid sequences between A56-1S and A56-1R (data not shown).



Repression of IMP-6 MBL production by ArdK

To determine whether ArdK mutated by IS26 insertion is involved in blaIMP-6 expression, differences in IMP-6 MBL production between transformants with ArdK and mutated ArdK were analyzed using a blaIMP-6-based reporter assay.
The ardK genes and regions upstream of blaIMP-6 from pA56-1S (UPS) and pA56-1R (UPR) were cloned separately into plasmids and transformed into an E. coli OmniMAX laboratory strain free from IncN-related genes including ardK, UPS and UPR on pA56-1S/pA56-1R (Fig 3).
The transformants were tested using the Carba NP test and broth microdilution.
The transformant carrying UPS (Omni-UPS) was positive on the Carba NP test and showed a MEM MIC of &gt; 32 mg/L, suggesting that Omni-UPS produced IMP-6 MBL (Fig 3).
The cotransformant with ardK (Omni-UPS_A) demonstrated negative results on the Carba NP test and MEM MIC of 0.25 - 0.5 mg/L, whereas the cotransformant with mutated ardK (Omni-UPS_mA) was positive on the Carba NP test and showed MEM MIC of &gt; 32 mg/L (Fig 3), suggesting markedly reduced carbapenemase production in cotransformants carrying intact ardK.
in addition, the Carba NP test and MEM MIC for UPR suggest that ArdK can modulate the expression of blaIMP-6 in transformants carrying either UPS or UPR (Fig 3).



Characterization of the ArdK binding region on pA56-1S

The above results suggest that ArdK could repress the transcription of blaIMP-6 (Fig 3).
To identify the ArdK binding region upstream of blaIMP-6, EMSA was performed using a biotin-labeled DNA probe upstream of blaIMP-6 on pA56-1S.
Three ArdK binding sites CUP5, CUPA and CUPB have been previously reported as conserved upstream sequences involved in the regulation of ardB, ardK and repA, respectively, on the IncN plasmid [16].
Comparative analysis of the upstream region of blaIMP-6 and these three sequences showed that the 13 consensus nucleotides (CUPA56, 4812 - 4824 nt in pA56-1S) were well aligned (CUP5, 84.6%; CUPB, 84.6%; CUPA, 69.2%; Fig 4A).
A 107-bp DNA probe that included the consensus nucleotides labeled by biotin was amplified from pA56-1S, and EMSA was performed with the probe and recombinant ArdK (intact form on pA56-1S) or mArdK (C-terminus-deleted form on pA56-1R; Fig 4B).
The results showed that the band corresponding to the probe was shifted by ArdK binding but not by mArdK.
A nonspecific competition assay using a 30-fold weight excess of unlabeled mammalian genomic DNA showed that specific ArdK binding was retained as the band shift without competitor inhibition (Fig 4B).
The binding affinity of ArdK for the 107 bp DNA probe was analyzed using the Octet RED96 system, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) value was 2.93 +- 0.0673 x 10-8 M (Fig 4C).

86 genes belong to the Crl regulon

Available information regarding the Crl regulon was gathered through an exhaustive review of the literature.
In this regard, diverse experimental evidences were considered significant for determining the association between the regulated genes and Crl protein regulator, such as gene expression analysis (transcriptional fusions), mapping of signal intensities (RNA-seq or microarray analysis), and inferences made from a mutant phenotype (mutation of a TF with a visible cell phenotype), among other analyses.
Therefore, 86 genes were included in this work as members of the sigmaS sigmulon, of which 37 had already been reported in both RegulonDB and EcoCyc database; whereas, 49 genes identified by microarray data and crl rpoS double mutants [8 - 16], in previous works were also added (see Additional file 1).
From the 86 genes identified as members of this regulon (see Table 1 and Fig. 1), 34 have a sigmaS-type promoter experimentally determined and 8 genes have 13 sigmaS-type promoters predicted by computational approaches [17].
These 86 genes are organized in 77 transcription units (TUs), where 52% are TUs with only one gene.

Previously, genes under the control of Crl were classified in four main categories depending on their role(s) in the cell: DNA metabolism, central metabolism, response to environmental modifications, and miscellaneous [11].
Based on Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, multifunctional classification, and KEGG pathway maps to categorize functions, Crl-regulated genes appear to be involved in metabolic processes such as energy metabolism, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, and biosynthetic processes such as glycan biosynthesis and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, among other metabolic processes.
These functions correlate with results of the enrichment analysis using PANTHER, which showed that catabolic processes, metabolic processes, and cellular responses to xenobiotic stimuli were overrepresented among the functions associated with genes under the control of Crl (See Fig. 2).

In general, genes under Crl control are involved in regulating many aspects of cellular metabolism through Crl's interaction with a subset of genes of the sigmaS regulon [8] in addition to quorum sensing playing a major role in cell-to-cell communication during stationary phase and in different processes such as biofilm formation or virulence, transporters [11] and genes involved in the uptake and utilization of beta-glucosides [16].



Composition of the Crl regulon

In order to determine whether additional TFs also regulate the genes under the control of Crl, RegulonDB was used to evaluate how genes associated with Crl are also regulated by alternative TFs or sigma factors.
A total of 24 genes were identified as exclusively controlled by Crl, whereas 62 are regulated by additional TFs (See Additional file 2).
In this regard, 55 different TFs are involved in the regulation of genes associated with Crl, including Crp, IHF, H-NS, Fis, FNR, ArcA, GadX, GadW, GadE, and CsgD (Table 1), suggesting that all genes regulated by Crl are also involved in multiple functions beyond the stationary phase, or, alternatively, phase transition has to regulate genes involved in large number of different functions.
It is interesting that six of seven global regulators identified in the regulatory network of E. coli are also associated with the set regulated by Crl.
Another way to look at this small network is that 19 genes of the total of Crl-regulated genes are regulated by one TF, 11 by two TFs, and 14 by three different TFs.
Therefore, Crl is regulating positively 73 (85%) genes, whereas 12 (15%) genes are regulated negatively (Table 1).
The predominance of positive regulation suggests that genes associated with this regulon are in high demand according the demand theory suggested by Savageau [18], and the activities of their proteins are enhanced to contend with varied environmental stimuli.
Thirty-four of the 86 genes have a sigmaS-type promoter that was experimentally determined (RegulonDB).
Finally, the promoters of 49 genes identified as members of Crl and of the sigmaS sigmulon, based on transcriptional fusions and microarray analysis data, remain to be experimentally determined.



Phylogenetic analysis of Crl

In order to evaluate the phylogenetic history of Crl across the bacterial and archaeal cellular domains, its homologs were identified as described in the Methods section, and a phylogenetic tree with maximum likelihood was generated (Fig. 3 and Additional file 3).
From this analysis, we found that Crl and its homologs are distributed almost exclusively among Gammaproteobacteria but do not share homology with proteins from other taxonomical divisions, as has been previously noted for E. coli, Vibrio spp., Citrobacter spp., Salmonella spp., and Enterobacter aerogenes [16].
Additional information suggests that Crl is less widespread and less conserved at the sequence level than sigmaS [19].
In this regard, four conserved residues (Y22, F53, W56, and W82) are important for Crl activity and for Crl-sigmaS interaction but not for Crl stability in S. Typhimurium [19].
On one hand it is probable that Crl homologs exist in some sigmaS-containing bacteria; however, some species might use alternative strategies to favor sigmaS interaction with the core of the RNAP [19].
Therefore, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that Crl is a protein conserved and constrained to Gammaproteobacteria, such as in Vibrio spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli.
Contrary to Crl, several other of the TFs that co-regulate the Crl regulon, are present beyond the gamma-proteobacterial, probably pre-dating regulation of some of the target genes, which have been more recently subject to Crl regulation.

In addition, homologous of Crl were found in low copy numbers, i.e., one Crl-like protein per genome.
This information, together with the distribution of sigmaS, suggests that the regulator was recruited as an element to regulate a subset of sigmaS-regulated genes in Gammaproteobacteria.
In this regard, it is interesting that genes under the control of Crl contain an UP element with A/T-rich DNA sequence upstream of a poorly conserved - 35 promoter which may serve for alpha subunit binding of RNAP; suggesting that Crl could play a fundamental role in the contacts between RNAP and its promoter [13].
In addition, Crl would increase transcription rate during the transition from growing to stationary phase at low temperatures [8], using indole as an effector molecule.
In summary, this result opens the question explored in the follow section of whether genes regulated by Crl are also constrained to this taxonomical division.



Taxonomical distribution of Crl-regulated genes

Based on the identification of orthologs of 86 Crl-regulated genes, we evaluated their taxonomical distribution across archaea and bacteria sequence genomes, as described in Methods (See Fig. 4 and Additional file 4).
Based on a taxonomical profile, we determined that the evolution of the Crl regulon seems to have involved diverse losses and gains of regulatory interactions.
It is possible that large portions of the regulatory network associated with Crl evolved through extensive genetic changes during the evolution of the species studied.
Indeed, we suggest three main events modeled the evolution of this regulon: (i) the regulation of a large number of genes widely distributed among Bacteria and Archaea, such as those genes involved in ancient metabolic processes such as glycolysis (fbaB, pykF, pfkA, and sucA) and those involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (gltA and sucD) [20]; (ii) the regulation of genes with a distribution pattern mainly constrained to Proteobacteria, with some secondary losses in other organisms, such as those genes involved in response to stress and starvation (cstA and hdcA) or cell adhesion (csgA and csgB), among others; and (iii) the recruitment of Crl as a consequence of its emergence in Enterobacteriales.
It is interesting that Crl-regulated genes are also part of the sigmaS sigmulon, where there are no essential genes [21 - 24].
All these elements suggest that the Crl regulon is highly flexible for phenotypic adaptation, probably as a consequence of the diverse growth environments associated with the organisms in which members of this regulatory network are present.

Transcription of mafR under laboratory conditions

The genome of the E. faecalis strain OG1RF has been totally sequenced (GenBank CP002621.1)14.
By quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays and using the comparative CT method15, we determined the relative expression of the regulatory mafR gene (locus_tag OG1RF_12293) in cells grown under laboratory conditions (Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, 37 degrees C, without aeration) to both logarithmic and stationary phases.
Transcription of mafR was found to be higher at logarithmic phase.
Compared to stationary phase, the fold change (log2FC) in mafR expression was ~4.
Therefore, all the experiments shown in this work were performed at the logarithmic growth phase.



Gene OG1RF_12294 encodes a putative P-type ATPase cation transporter

P-type ATPases constitute a large superfamily of cation and lipid pumps that use ATP hydrolysis for energy.
They are integral, multispanning membrane proteins that are found in bacteria and in a number of eukaryotic plasma membranes and organelles16.
The enterococcal OG1RF_12294 gene, which is adjacent to mafR (Fig. 1A), encodes a putative P-type ATPase cation transporter.
Such a gene has been annotated as pmr1 (GeneID: 12289043) because it encodes a protein (850 amino acids) that has sequence similarity (~52%) to eukaryotic PMR1 (plasma membrane ATPase related) P-type ATPases (Supplementary Table S1).
Some PMR1-type pumps are able to transport calcium, as well as manganese, into the Golgi apparatus17 - 19.

In addition to OG1RF_12294, the OG1RF genome encodes two putative calcium-transporting ATPases: OG1RF_10600 and OG1RF_11602 (Supplementary Table S2).
Using the BLASTP protein sequence alignment program20, we found that OG1RF_12294 has sequence similarity (~53 - 56%) to both ATPases (Supplementary Table S1).
Furthermore, OG1RF_12294 has sequence similarity (~53 - 56%) to several prokaryotic proteins characterized as calcium P-type ATPases (Supplementary Table S1)21 - 25.
Thus, protein OG1RF_12294 might contribute to maintain calcium homeostasis in enterococcal cells.



MafR influences positively the transcription of OG1RF_12294

To analyse whether MafR regulates the expression of the OG1RF_12294 gene, we determined its relative expression in OG1RF (wild-type) and OG1RFDeltamafR (deletion mutant) by qRT-PCR.
The log2FC in OG1RF_12294 expression due to the presence of MafR was ~3, indicating that MafR has a positive effect on the transcription of such a gene.
This conclusion was further confirmed by increasing the intracellular level of MafR.
Specifically, we determined the relative expression of OG1RF_12294 in two strains: OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLF (absence of MafR) and OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR).
In addition, we determined the relative expression of the OG1RF_10600 and OG1RF_11602 genes, which encode putative calcium-transporting ATPases (Supplementary Table S1).
In the presence of plasmid-encoded MafR, only transcription of OG1RF_12294 was increased (log2FC ~4).
Thus, MafR influences positively and specifically the transcription of the OG1RF_12294 gene.



MafR activates the P12294 promoter in vivo

In the OG1RF genome14, the ATG codon at coordinate 2425611 is likely the translation start site of the OG1RF_12294 gene (Fig. 1A).
It is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site sequence (AGGAGG).
Upstream of such a sequence there is a putative promoter (here named P12294) that has a canonical -10 element (TATAAT) but lacks a potential -35 element (consensus TTGACA) at the optimal length of 17 nucleotides.
Nevertheless, there is a near-consensus -35 element (TCGACC) at the suboptimal spacer length of 22 nucleotides.
These features suggested that promoter P12294 could be recognized by a sigma factor similar to the Escherichia coli sigma70 and that its activity could be enhanced by regulatory proteins.
Sequence analysis of the region located between the TAA stop codon of the OG1RF_12295 gene (coordinate 2425761) and the P12294 promoter revealed the existence of an inverted-repeat (IR) that may function as a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator (Fig. 1A).

To characterize the P12294 promoter, a 255-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 2425885 to 2425631) (Fig. 2) was inserted into the pASTT promoter-probe vector, which is based on the gfp reporter gene.
The recombinant plasmid (pASTT-P12294) was first introduced into OG1RF and OG1RFDeltamafR.
In these strains, the expression of gfp (0.32 +- 0.02 and 0.26 +- 0.04 units, respectively) was similar to the basal level (OG1RF harbouring pASTT; 0.38 +- 0.02 units).
Different results were obtained when pASTT-P12294 was introduced into OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring either pDLF or pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR) (Fig. 2).
The expression of gfp was ~2.5-fold higher in the presence of plasmid-encoded MafR.
This result indicated that the 255-bp DNA fragment contains a MafR-dependent promoter activity.
Removal of the -10 element of the P12294 promoter resulted in loss of such an activity (plasmid pASTT-P12294Delta-10).
A further deletion analysis allowed us to conclude that the 186-bp region between coordinates 2425816 and 2425631 contains both the P12294 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR (plasmids pASTT-P12294Delta69 and pASTT-P12294Delta208) (Fig. 2).



MafR binds to the P12294 promoter region in vitro

To investigate whether MafR activates directly the expression of the OG1RF_12294 gene, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments.
We used a His-tagged MafR protein (MafR-His) and a 270-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 2425817 to 2425548).
This fragment contains the P12294 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR in vivo (Fig. 2).
The presence of a His-tag at the C-terminal end of MafR does not affect its DNA-binding properties4.
The 270-bp DNA fragment was radioactively labelled either at the 5'-end of the coding strand or at the 5'-end of the non-coding strand (Fig. 3).
On the coding strand and at 100 nM of MafR-His, protections against DNase I digestion were observed within the region spanning coordinates 2425708 and 2425658.
On the non-coding strand and at 125 nM of MafR-His, diminished cleavages were observed between coordinates 2425712 and 2425686.
Thus, MafR-His recognizes a site overlapping the -35 element of the P12294 promoter (Fig. 3).
This result allowed us to conclude that MafR activates directly the transcription of the OG1RF_12294 gene.

Figure 1B shows the bendability/curvature propensity plot of the 270-bp DNA fragment according to the bend.it program26.
The profile contains an intrinsic curvature of high magnitude (~13 degrees per helical turn), which is adjacent to the MafR binding site.
In addition, the site recognized by MafR contains a region of potential bendability (~5.2 units).



Gene OG1RF_11486 encodes a putative QueT transporter family protein

Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters are a family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that are responsible for the uptake of essential micronutrients in prokaryotes.
They consist of a membrane-embedded S-component that provides substrate specificity and a three-subunit ECF module that couples ATP hydrolysis to transport.
In the so-called group II ECF transporters, different S-components share the same ECF module.
Furthermore, the S-component genes are not located in the same operon as the genes for the ECF module27 - 29.

The enterococcal OG1RF_11486 gene encodes a putative QueT transporter family protein (GenBank AEA94173.1).
Proteins identical to OG1RF_11486 (173 residues) are encoded by Mycobacterium abscessus (CPW17925.1), Listeria monocytogenes (CWW42654.1; 172 up to 173 residues are identical) and S. agalactiae (KLL29182.1).
In the two former bacteria, the corresponding protein has been annotated as queuosine precursor ECF transporter S-component QueT.
Therefore, protein OG1RF_11486 could be involved in the uptake of a queuosine biosynthetic intermediate.
Using the BLASTP program20, we found that the OG1RF genome encodes an additional QueT transporter family protein (OG1RF_12031; 168 residues; AEA94718.1).
It has 55% of similarity to the OG1RF_11486 protein.



MafR activates the P11486 promoter in vivo

By qRT-PCR assays, we found that MafR has a positive effect on the transcription of OG1RF_11486.
Compared to strain OG1RFDeltamafR, the relative expression of OG1RF_11486 was slightly higher in strain OG1RF (log2FC ~0.9).
Moreover, the relative expression of OG1RF_11486 was higher in strain OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR) than in strain OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLF (log2FC ~2.4).

The BPROM program (Softberry, Inc.) predicts a promoter sequence (named P11486 herein) upstream of the OG1RF_11486 gene.
The -35 (TTTACA) and -10 (TAACAT) elements of this promoter are separated by 17 nucleotides (Fig. 4A).
By primer extension using total RNA from OG1RF cells, we demonstrated that the P11486 promoter is functional in vivo (Fig. 5).
Oligonucleotide R11486-D was used as primer (Table 1).
A cDNA product of 130 nucleotides was detected, indicating that transcription of OG1RF_11486 starts at coordinate 1543115 (Fig. 4A).

To further characterize the P11486 promoter, we constructed several transcriptional fusions (Fig. 6).
A 284-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 1542902 to 1543185) was inserted into pASTT.
The recombinant plasmid (pASTT-P11486) was first introduced into OG1RF and OG1RFDeltamafR.
In both strains, gfp expression (1.48 +- 0.10 and 1.51 +- 0.16 units, respectively) was ~4-fold higher than the basal level (OG1RF harbouring pASTT).
This result indicated that the 284-bp DNA fragment has promoter activity, however, the chromosomal copy of mafR is not sufficient to activate such a promoter located on pASTT (multicopy plasmid).
Next, we introduced pASTT-P11486 into OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR).
In this strain, gfp expression was ~3-fold higher than in the control strain (OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLF) (Fig. 6).
Similar results were obtained with plasmids pASTT-P11486Delta66 and pASTT-P11486Delta145, which allowed us to conclude that the 139-bp region between coordinates 1543047 and 1543185 contains both the P11486 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR.
A further deletion analysis showed that sequences between coordinates 1543047 and 1543071 (plasmid pASTT-P11486Delta169) are needed for MafR-mediated activation of the P11486 promoter but not for promoter activity.
Moreover, deletion of the region that spans coordinates 1543071 and 1543090 (plasmid pASTT-P11486Delta188) removes the -35 element of the P11486 promoter and, consequently, reduces the expression of gfp to basal levels (Fig. 6).



MafR binds to the P11486 promoter region in vitro

By DNase I footprinting assays, we analysed whether MafR-His binds to the P11486 promoter region (Fig. 7).
We used a 275-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 1542969 to 1543243), which contains both the P11486 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR in vivo (Fig. 6).
On the coding strand and at 350 nM of MafR-His, changes in DNase I sensitivity (diminished cleavages) were observed within the region spanning coordinates 1543047 and 1543110.
On the non-coding strand and at 300 nM of MafR-His, diminished cleavages were observed between coordinates 1543043 and 1543110.
On both strands and at 400 nM of MafR-His, regions protected against DNase I digestion were observed along the DNA fragment, which is consistent with the ability of MafR-His to generate multimeric complexes4.
Therefore, MafR-His recognizes preferentially a DNA site overlapping the P11486 core promoter.
Such a DNA site includes sequences needed for MafR-mediated activation of the P11486 promoter in vivo (Fig. 6).
According to the bendability/curvature propensity plot of the 275-bp DNA fragment, the MafR binding site contains regions of potential bendability (Fig. 4B).

Phenotypical characterization of scoC deletion mutant

A scoC deletion mutant strain (BA06-del-scoC) was successfully disrupted by homologous recombination following the strategy as showed in Fig.1 and confirming by colony PCR and DNA sequencing (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Furthermore, an overexpression strain (del-scoC/scoC+) was also constructed to overexpression ScoC on the multiple-copies plasmids (pSU03-scoC).

Firstly, we compared the growth pattern of the wild-type (wt), scoC deletion mutant (BA06-del-scoC), and scoC/scoC+ overexpression strains.
Figure 2a showed that the defect or overexpression of scoC did not affect the cell growth in MM broth in comparison with the wt.
Secondly, since the previous studies in B. subtilis showed that ScoC negatively regulated protease genes of aprE and nprE, and scoC disruption led to significant increase of extracellular protease activity [19, 24], the total extracellular protease activity was determined in of B. pumilus (Fig. 2b).
It was showed that scoC deletion caused 2-fold increase in extracellular proteolytic activity compared to the wt at the time point of 60 h. On the other hand, overexpression of scoC in the del-scoC/scoC+ strain reversed to diminish the increased extracellular protease activity.
Like in B. subtilis, ScoC acted as a negative regulator of extracellular proteases in B. pumilus.

Next, we examined the bacterial motility on the solid and semi-solid plates with agar concentrations of 0.7 and 0.3% [25].
Figure 3 showed that the colony size of BA06-del-scoC was much smaller than that of the wt and del-scoC/scoC+ strains on LB plate with 0.7% agar and MM plate with 0.3% agar, respectively, indicating that both the swarming and swimming motility were compromised after scoC disruption.
The colony expansion in diameter of BA06-del-scoC was statistically different from the wt and overexpression strains with p &lt; 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.
These results indicated that scoC could modulate the cell motility of B. pumilus.

Since flagellum is the movement organ of bacteria, we counted the cell number with flagella or without flagella for the three B. pumilus strains.
It was found that scoC disruption reduced the flagella formation (Fig. 4).
The percentage of cells with flagella were only 23.7% for BA06-del-ScoC.
By contrast, the percentages were 69.8 and 71.1% for the wt and overexpression strains, respectively.
Of interest, previous studies done in B. subtilis showed that many flagellar genes were downregulated in scoC deletion mutant [22].
These results suggested that decrease of cell motility of BA06-del-scoC was at least partially resulted from the reduction of flagella formation.

In addition, formation of endospore and biofilm was also examined.
In contrast to B. subtilis, no significant difference was found among the three B. pumilus stains (Additional file 2: Figure S2), implicating ScoC also plays strain-specific role.



Transcriptome profiling of scoC mutant

To better understand the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypes in B. pumilus, we performed comparative transcriptome profiling using RNA sequencing.
Overall, a total 1674 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the expression level &gt; 2.5-fold change and p &lt; 0.01 were identified across the three time points at which the BA06-del-scoC and wt cells were compared (Fig. 5a, Additional file 3: Table S1).
The most DEGs were identified at the time point of 12 h with 531 up-regulated and 467 down-regulated.
And DEGs subsequently declined at the later growth phases, suggesting that scoC may play a major role at the transition phase.

By KEGG pathway analysis, the DEGs were categorized into various metabolic pathways, of which the top 10 were displayed in Fig. 5b.
Overall, the expression patterns are very similar between B. subtilis and B. pumilus after scoC disruption.
The largest group with altered transcriptional level in the scoC deletion mutant belongs to the KEGG category of membrane transport [22].
For example, some putative operons involved in the metal ion transport systems (cds3101 - 3105; cds3029 - 3032) were downregulated in BA06-del-scoC strain (Additional file 3: Table S1).
In B. subtilis, some operons like opp and app encoding oligopeptide transport systems have been experimentally confirmed to be directly regulated by scoC [20].
In addition, many affected genes were also enriched in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, transcription, etc.

Nevertheless, there are also significant differences from B. subtilis.
For instance, two protease genes aprE (cds0935) and aprX (cds1594) showed same expression pattern, i.e. upregulation in both strains at 24 and 36 h (Table 1), while the neutral protease gene aprN (cds2061) was decreased in B. pumilus but increased in B. subtilis, respectively.
Furthermore, the other protease gene like epr (cds0246) and vpr (cds3474) did not changed obviously in transcription level in B. pumilus after scoC deletion (Table 1).
Because the proteases like AprE is regulated by both positive and negative regulators in B. subtilis, herein we examined transcriptional level of the homologous regulatory genes in B. pumilus.
It was showed that the negative regulator gene abrB (cds0014) and sinR (cds2171) did not change (Additional file 3: Table S1).
However, the sensor histidine kinase gene degS (cds3226) were upregulated at 12 h, which may promote the phosphorylation level of DegU and in turn enhance the transcription of aprE [26].
This is consistent with increased aprE expression.

Since the scoC mutation displayed defective flagella formation (Fig. 4), we examined the transcriptional profiling of flagella-related genes.
In B. pumilus, these genes are organized as several operons (like flc/che and motAB) or individually scattered in the genome (Additional file 4: Figure S3).
Overall, 63 genes categorized into the KEGG Bacterial Motility (k02035) and Flagellar Assembly (k02040) pathways have a trend to downregulation in BA06-del-scoC strain (Fig. 6a, Additional file 3: Table S1).
Nevertheless, seldom genes were upregulated.
For example, the flgM gene (cds3219, encoding an anti-sigma factor) were upregulated for about 3-fold at 12 h (Additional file 4: Figure S3).
In the fla/che operon, the upregulated genes (fliEFGH, fliJ) may be transcribed from another independent promoter [27].
In addition, the gene swrA encoding a master regulator of motility that activates the cell motility in B. subtilis [28], was also upregulated in scoC deletion mutant of B. pumilus.
Taken together, the transcriptome data suggest that the compromised flagella formation is at least in part due to downregulation of the flagellar structural genes after scoC deletion.

Another group of DEGs is enriched into the KEGG Cell Growth pathway (99978).
Most of these genes related to sporulation were continually upregulated at all three time points in BA06-del-scoC (Fig. 6b), consistent with the finding that scoC disruption promoted sporulation in B. subtilis [17, 24].
However, no overt enhanced sporulation was observed in B. pumilus (Additional file 2: Figure S2A), implicating there might existed additional regulatory pathway in B. pumilus.
Of note, these sporulation-related genes are still not found to interact directly with ScoC.
Therefore, scoC may undergo an indirect pathway to regulate sporulation.
For example, scoC can suppress sporulation by acting as a repressor of the signaling peptide transport systems, opp and app in B. subtilis [20].
Indeed, we found the opp operon (oppABCDF, cds1038 - 1042) was downregulated at 12 h and then upregulated at 24 h in B. pumilus scoC mutant (Additional file 3: Table S1).

Lastly, to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of the transcriptome data, 13 genes were selected for qPCR validation.
RNA samples from the same cultures of MM at different growth phases were used as template.
The data shown in Table S2 (Additional file 5) indicated that RNA-seq data were almost consistent with the qPCR results.
